The track also includes a candid conversation where the singer explains her and Konecki's split to their son, Angelo, when the child was six years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the interview, Adele shared that the song was meant to go through her son's emotional journey during the split as much as her own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I wrote it for Angelo, and I wrote it to shine a light [that] I didn't always have it together," she said. "It is very personal, and he probably will go through stages of hating it when he's a teenager, but it was an important part of the puzzle I was trying to figure out of my life — not the album — so I had to include it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The "Easy On Me" singer then reflected on a moment in the recorded conversation where she admitted to her son that she didn't know what she was doing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Imagine hearing that as a 6-year-old. 'What do you mean you don't know what you're doing?' You panic, and your whole world would implode," she said, laughing. "I was just trying to be clear with him and just be honest with him, but it was intense."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Definitely by making that song, it sorted out some of the clutter that was going on in my ability to talk about how I was feeling," she added, calling the process "a big breakthrough."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The "Hello" singer also revealed the details behind the solo voice note of the song, which she said was a voicemail that she left to her best friend.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"That night I put Angelo to bed, when I recorded that, and we actually had a really good bedtime, and stuff like that, and then I fell apart afterwards," she said. "I was consistent for that one evening, and afterwards just completely fell apart, and I'm not ashamed of that. I think a lot of parents hide things from their kids, as we should in most cases, but I couldn't hide from him. He could see me even clearer if I tried to hide from him."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">See Adele's full interview below.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
