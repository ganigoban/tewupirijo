She told an anecdote about reading a lot on set because of all the time she spent suspended in various harnesses for the film's "underwater" scenes, and it turned out her co-star didn't like that hobby very much. "Jason's allergic to being ignored," Heard quipped, after agreeing with host Jimmy Fallon that Momoa is a "positive, happy dude."
