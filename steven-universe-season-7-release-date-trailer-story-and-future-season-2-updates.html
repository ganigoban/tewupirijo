<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Steven Universe Season 7 Release Date, Trailer, Story and Future Season 2 Updates</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Steven Universe Season 7 release date is highly expected by fans after the sixth season ended very quickly on the Cartoon Network channel. It was also known as Steven Universe Future and kind of took the story forward in a different way. However, the previous season of Steven Universe just aired for a total of five weeks with two episodes in each slot and fans of the show are looking for more.</p><p>https://twitter.com/taikova/status/1219654028835028993</p><p>It is why Rebecca Sugar must be working on season 7 of Steven Universe with a fresh new story. Hence, we can assume that Steven Universe Season 7 trailer and renewal would be confirmed soon and as for <a href=#>Steven Universe Future season 2, it might not happen at all</a>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Steven_Universe_Future_Season_2_Update></span>Steven Universe Future Season 2 Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Steven-Universe-Future-Season-2-Update.jpg alt="Steven Universe Future Season 2 Update" width=1200 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Steven Universe season 6 ended with “Little Graduation” and “Prickly Pair” as the final two episodes. Cartoon Network or the show creator Rebecca Sugar has not given any further updates after that and there is no official announcement regarding the next season.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Its been a year since Steven Universe ended, heres an old doodle of the boy I'm fond of to remember it by. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FNaEGZBW8F</a></p><p>— Drawendo (@Drawendo) <a href=# rel=noopener>January 21, 2020</a></p><p>While there is a lot more to tell in the story of Steven Universe, the last season was just continuation of the fifth installment and it won’t be expanded any further. It simply means that there won’t be any Steven Universe Future season 2 as that story was meant as a conclusion to Season 5 finale, ‘Change Your Mind’ and after that, it serves no purpose.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Steven_Universe_Season_7_Trailer_Plot_and_Release_Date></span>Steven Universe Season 7 Trailer, Plot and Release Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Steven-Universe-Season-7-Trailer-Plot-and-Release-Date.jpg alt="Steven Universe Season 7 Trailer, Plot and Release Date" width=1200 height=680 data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Steven Universe Season 7 has a lot of possibilities as Rebecca Sugar can easily write stories for more episodes. There are so many storylines to explore and they can also show Steven as a gem and expand his backstory.</p><p>Steven Universe will easily be renewed for the seventh season given it is one of the most popular CN shows. As per the rumors, Steven Universe season 7 will have an August 2020 release date and the trailer would come out around June-July this year.</p><p>[fvplayer id=”2678″]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2iqrZ2mmrtuwc2irZ6qo5p6tLHArKanZWdiv6a4xJqqnmWUlsGmedOrmKKklad6tMDOq7BmmZ6ZeqfB066pnmWjmq60u81maWatoJmutbHSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scarlett-johansson-rare-comment-baby-son-cosmo-adorable.html><span>←</span><span>Scarlett Johansson makes revelation about rarely seen son and he's adorable</span></a>
