And, just to make the movie live up to its genre of fantasy and supernatural, Adam sees his parents the same age as he is, and living their lives like it was yesterday. However, this doesn’t make a lot of sense since his parents were killed in a car crash when he was a child.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7d649e6858e8-002strangersr1230721jsg2-7175100255923still005r.jpg><p id=eKcP_1xxMMkQ data-wc=46>Speaking about the two lead stars, the director Andrew Haigh told Vanity Fair: "There was chemistry between the two of them literally the second I saw them together… Both of them were pretty fearless.
