Her exciting new life comes with an exciting new love, but there's more to Mexican actor Sebastián Zurita's character, Dylan, than the charming demeanor that Alice is initially attracted to. And what lurks beneath the surface should remind her of the frightening situation that she was so desperate to escape as a child. "For me, it's where (the characters) come from, how can I humanize them, how can I give them other kinds of colors, how can you make them be charismatic and charming and then show a dark, predatory side in some way," Zurita told <a href=#>AP</a>&nbsp; of the challenge of playing a disarming deceiver like Dylan.</p><p>Zurita started&nbsp;acting when he was a child and has starred in several telenovelas, including "En nombre del amor." He's also a producer, writer, and director, and he and his brother, Emiliano, co-created Amazon Prime Video's first original scripted Spanish series, "Cómo Sobrevivir Soltero." Zurita's role in&nbsp;"The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart" resonated with him because domestic violence is a major problem in his home country, but he shared that the hope of everyone who worked on the show is that it will raise awareness worldwide of something that is a global issue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmaYB4gI6erZ6qqam1qrrGZq6eZZujvLh5wJumrqxdqbWmecKaqq1ln5t6tbTEZqOoq6Ris6271p6prGWfm3qiuMicnGagkafBcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deforest-buckner-height-weight-body-measurements-family-bio.html><span>←</span><span>DeForest Buckner Height, Weight, Body Net Worth, Family, Bio</span></a>
