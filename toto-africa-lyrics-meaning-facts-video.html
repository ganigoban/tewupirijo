It was like God channeling it. I thought, 'I'm talented, but I'm not that talented. Something just happened here!'"</p><p class=paragraph-text>Paich then spent about six months refining the lyrics, before showing the song to the rest of the band.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=24><h2 class=title>What is 'Africa' by Toto about?</h2><figure>Toto - Africa. <span class=attribution>Picture: Columbia</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>In 2015, David Paich said that the song is about a man's love of the continent Africa, rather than a personal romance.</p><p class=paragraph-text>He based the lyrics around a late night documentary with depictions of African plight and suffering. It had a lasting impact on him: "It both moved and appalled me, and the pictures just wouldn't leave my head. I tried to imagine how I'd feel about it if I was there and what I'd do."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Jeff Porcaro added: "A white boy is trying to write a song on Africa, but since he's never been there, he can only tell what he's seen on TV or remembers in the past."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Further lyrics are about a person flying in to meet a lonely missionary, as Paich explained in 2018. As a child, he attended a Catholic school, and several of his teachers had done missionary work in Africa.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At the time, Paich had never set foot in Africa, and based the song's landscape descriptions from an article in National Geographic.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=10><h2 class=title>It almost didn't make the album at all</h2><p class=paragraph-text>Steve Porcaro and Steve Lukather once described the song as "dumb" and "an experiment", and that some of the lyrics were "goofy", particularly the line about the Serengeti.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Steve Porcaro said it was the last song they recorded and it barely made the cut for the album.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At one stage, Jeff Porcaro considered saving 'Africa' for a solo album as other members didn't think it sounded like a Toto song. At the time, the band were more focused on the album's lead single 'Rosanna'.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=0.9748743718593><h2 class=title>An Eagles member features on the song</h2><figure>Timothy B Schmit. <span class=attribution>Picture: <a href=#>Getty</a></span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>'Africa' saw Eagles member Timothy B Schmit provide a 12-string acoustic guitar to the song, and he also sang backing vocals.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=17><h2 class=title>What happens in the video?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/FTQbiNvZqaY/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Toto - Africa (Official Video)</p><p class=paragraph-text>The music video was directed by Steve Barron.
