He is currently age 76 years old.</p><h3>Les Brown Quotes</h3><p>Several quotes are attributed to him, including:</p><li>It truly is beautiful to see a child’s perspective on life because it’s always so pure. I love sitting down with my grandchildren and just talking to them because it reminds me of the fearless audacity we all once had.</li><li>In order to do something you’ve never done, you’ve got to become someone you’ve never been. I think that all of us have great potential within us, but greatness is a choice; it’s not our destiny. And in the pursuit of our dreams, we are introduced to trials, failures and, which take us to the door of discovery and greatness.</li><li>The world is waiting for you to wake up to the person you are called to be. Stop listening to the negative inner conversation that’s causing you to play small. Focus your mind on positive thoughts, possibilities and solutions that can move you forward. Tap into your creativity and determination and stay busy. Stay focused.</li><li>Avoid head trash. Don’t be a garbage can for anything that does not feed your intellect, stimulate your imagination, or make you a more compassionate peaceful person. Refuse to open your mind to other people’s trash. Tune out anything that promotes conflict or controversy. This can infect you with a mind virus of cynicism or defeat, and you won’t even know it!</li><li>“The graveyard is the richest place on earth, because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung, the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered, all because someone was too afraid to take that first step, keep with the problem, or determined to carry out their dream.”</li><li>“Accept responsibility for your life. Know that it is you who will get you where you want to go, no one else.”</li><li>“The things you want are always possible; it is just that the way to get them is not always apparent. The only real obstacle in your path to a fulfilling life is you, and that can be a considerable obstacle because you carry the baggage of insecurities and past experience.”</li><li>“Wanting something is not enough. You must hunger for it. Your motivation must be absolutely compelling in order to overcome the obstacles that will invariably come your way.”</li><li>“I would rather fail at what I love than succeed at what I hate.”</li><li>“you don’t have to be great to get started but you have to to get started to be great”</li><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Les Brown – Motivation Legend (@thelesbrown)</a></p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
