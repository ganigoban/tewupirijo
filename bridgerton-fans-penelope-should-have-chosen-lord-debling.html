Pretending to be Penelope, TikTok user Babbity Kate said: “What? No Lord Debling, don’t marry me and then leave me for three years to pick new furniture for your enormous house, fill the library with new books and work on my personal projects in peace!&nbsp;</p><p id=eX2CU4a6iQo data-wc=79>“No, don’t let me do my own thing and then come back periodically on a predictable schedule so that we can both enjoy time together because we are both very nice and attractive and interesting people who do like each other, and maybe someday we’ll have a more romantic loving relationship but in the meantime, we can talk, and we can sleep together, and it will be nice. That’s a fate worse than death!

He's introverted and likes to watch from the peripherals of society and I think that makes him quite interesting because he's not honking after a lot of attention. He's just standing and looking from the outside – that was quite juicy to play.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6e56d36cd450-bridgerton-season-three-pen-and-colin.jpg><p id=e5knZ4ZH5O4f data-wc=63>He added: “There were nods to the fact that he's a conservationist with some of the colours – the greens… I just wanted him to look a bit different than the average member of the ton because he's quite bold in his choice of interests. With the colours as well, I wanted to make sure that they were slightly more interesting or different.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Bridgerton books in order</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/196b341fc162-bridgerton-s1.jpg><h3>The Bridgerton book series in order</h3><li>The Duke and I&nbsp;</li><li>The Viscount Who Loved Me&nbsp;</li><li>An Offer From a Gentleman&nbsp;</li><li>Romancing Mr. Bridgerton</li><li>To Sir Phillip, With Love</li><li>When He Was Wicked</li><li>It's In His Kiss</li><li>On The Way To The Wedding</li><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
