And if you started inviting one person, you feel like you've got to invite someone else. I just thought the only fair way to do this and the easiest way to keep it a secret was to just invite the bare minimum. So we went for sixty for the daytime and then I think in the evening we had like 120 because then I just invited everyone else that hadn't come during the day and it was just one big party.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVwsXtTDKwJ5 data-wc=1><strong>EXCLUSIVE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="JLS's Oritsé Williams announces engagement to Kazz Kumar - EXCLUSIVE" class=hm-link href=#>JLS's Oritsé Williams announces engagement to Kazz Kumar</a></strong></p><p id=eWt_ph0ztY3o data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Laura Kenny looks sensational in never-before-seen wedding photo with Jason" class=hm-link href=#>Laura Kenny looks sensational in never-before-seen wedding photo with Jason</a></strong></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eEGFd-Lntkvw data-wc=11><strong>The cycling stars&nbsp;only invited 60 guests to their wedding ceremony</strong></p><p id=eDJ49AwTpABv data-wc=62>"Obviously, we wanted it to be private and Jason is Catholic. We got married at a Catholic church so anyone can technically just go in. And I just thought, 'Oh, if this gets made public or just gets out, we could end up with people we don't actually even know there,'" said Laura, who has partnered with premium pet food brand <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>ORIJEN</a>.</p><p id=ez-5ZYsH-C-f data-wc=74>When asked how they chose who to invite to the ceremony, the Olympic gold medallist – who looked beautiful in three different wedding dresses for the occasion – added: "I just was ruthless, really! I was quite lucky that my family is quite small. I only have one cousin, for example, it's not like my family is massive. And so mine was quite easy because I got pretty much whoever I wanted to come.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f3b3f249949-laura-jason-cycling-medals-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0SXdyC51KX1 data-wc=10><strong>Laura admitted they couldn't invite all of their cycling friends</strong></p><p id=e4lLqrss8Mmu data-wc=71>"We split it 30/30/30 which was absolutely fine for my side of the family. But Jason's was trickier. We basically ditched all of his cousins – that's really mean, isn't it? It was the only way because obviously cousins have their partners and then it was just&nbsp;getting bigger and bigger. And like I say, because we were trying to create keep it quite quiet, we just had to be ruthless.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8s-iB9RnHT8 data-wc=73>"And then when it came to British cycling, there are so many people there that I class as friends, like teammates, for example, didn't come but they came in the evening because I just couldn't have one without having everyone. Even staff members like our mechanics and our carers, I couldn't have one without having everyone else. I didn't want 120 people for a sit-down meal. For me, it would have been infinite."</p><p id=e-XQOjN_3yg9 data-wc=43>Laura and Jason successfully pulled off a private wedding, with Jason proudly announcing the news on Twitter the following day. Posting a sweet picture of his bride posing in bed alongside their pet pooches, Sprolo and Pringle, he wrote: "Good morning Mrs Kenny."</p><p id=eJhREp9Om-e7 data-wc=31></p><p id=e6_Ic_dGnLfEA data-wc=1><strong>PHOTOS:&nbsp;<a aria-label="10 most expensive celebrity wedding dresses: Salma Hayek, Coleen Rooney and Serena Williams" class=hm-link href=#>10 most expensive celebrity wedding dresses: Salma Hayek, Coleen Rooney and Serena Williams</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
