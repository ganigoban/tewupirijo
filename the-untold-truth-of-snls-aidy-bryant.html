However, she wasn't even sure she'd gotten the coveted gig after meeting with the show's executive producer Lorne Michaels. After enduring the seemingly grueling audition process, which involved multiple trips to New York and some serious show business meetings, Bryant told the <a href=#>Daily Beast</a>, "[Michaels] was like, 'You're very young. You have to learn. But I think you'll do very well here.'" In turn, she admitted, "I was like, 'Does that ... does that mean ...' And then he stood up and shook my hand."</p><p>Bryant recalled that she was "kind of left like, 'What. Happened. To. Me?'" It wasn't until she was contacted by a producer from the show that she realized the truth. "[They were] like, 'You know you were hired, right?' And I was like, 'I did not. Thank you very much.'"</p><p>Nowadays, the star can credit her work on Saturday Night Live with earning her countless fans and <a href=#>two Emmy award nominations</a>. However, that doesn't mean that her career is easy-breezy. "There is an uncertainty on SNL that can be kind of jarring and can shake you up," Bryant told <a href=#>The Wrap</a> following her first Emmy nomination for acting in 2018. "But I also think, and maybe the proof of this is in all the different nominations for the show, that it makes you a hard-a** performer and writer and producer, because you've been through a lot of challenges."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29hbn11e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd50qejrGWRnrG6ecGrsJqmpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saddest-things-about-liza-minnelli.html><span>←</span><span>The Saddest Things About Liza Minnelli</span></a>
