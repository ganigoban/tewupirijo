But over the weekend, forty crew members put all the rumors to rest, and disputed that there was any friction while filming — particularly between director <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Olivia Wilde</a> and lead actress Florence Pugh.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an exclusive statement to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, the crew addressed a recent report from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Vulture</a> that claimed a "blowout argument" took place between Wilde and Pugh over the director's "frequent, unexplained absences" from set. An anonymous source, who reportedly spent "significant time" behind the scenes, alleged that Pugh and Wilde even got into a "screaming match" in front of everyone.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As a crew, we've avoided addressing the absurd gossip surrounding the movie we're so proud of, but feel the need to correct the anonymous 'sources' quoted in a recent article," the statement said, referring to the Vulture piece. "Any allegations about unprofessional behavior on the set of Don't Worry Darling are completely false." They added, "There was never a screaming match between our director and anyone, let alone a member of our cast."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The crew members went on to call Wilde "an incredible leader and director," revealing that she was very much involved "in every aspect of production."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are happy to put our names on this, as real people who worked on the film, and who have witnessed and benefitted from the collaborative and safe space Olivia creates as a director and leader," the statement continued, before concluding: "We're also thrilled that the movie is in theaters this weekend. We can't wait for you to see it on the big screen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same day, Pugh herself said she was "grateful" to be a part of the movie on Instagram — though, she failed to mention Wilde in her post. "This film was such an epic story on such a large scale to shoot, all while during peak Covid times. For that I will always be grateful," she wrote. "To all of you who helped make this, your dedication and love was seen daily - thank you. With that, here are some pics I took from this time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57k2lknaeeYsFuw86rqbJllJa%2FrbXNoGScqpWseq6xzJucq6tdqLmiuYyopWarlal6pb7ApphmqqWivLO%2FjJucra%2BVmrtuu8uiraKZXay2rbDEZpinnF2bubC%2BxKeanmWgqrSpeZVwa2xvaG4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./radish-recipes.html><span>←</span><span>29 Best Radish Recipes</span></a>
