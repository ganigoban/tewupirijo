However, the rapper went well beyond simply stating his voting preference. "We should have Donald Trump in office for 20 years," Black declared. Of course, this is not the first time that Black has linked up with the former President. Trump gave Black a presidential pardon, though that action did little to curtail Black's run-ins with the legal system.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I’m mafioso, bruh. He a Gemini just like me. His birthday three days after my sh-t. And that boy, he be vibing out here too [in Florida]". Black told Drink Champs last year. Furthermore, Black said he wouldn't hesitate to give Trump $1 million if the former President asked for it. He's not the only rapper to endorse Trump as of late. Earlier this week, Money Man also <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">threw his hat behind the embattled former President</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-donald-trump-promises-bloodbath-if-he-s-not-elected-campaign-tries-to-backpedal>Donald Trump Promises "Bloodbath" If He's Not Elected, Campaign Tries To Backpedal</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere, Trump once again threatened the end of democracy in the United States if he does not win the general election in November. “Now if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a bloodbath for the whole — that’s gonna be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country. That will be the least of it. But they’re not going to sell those cars. They’re building massive factories. If this election isn’t won, I’m not sure that you’ll ever have another election in this country," Trump said in a speech in Ohio. Trump's comments were riffing off previous ones he had made about the Chinese auto industry.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Trump's campaign has attempted to mitigate his comments. “Biden’s policies will create an economic bloodbath for the auto industry and autoworkers," campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told NBC. However, it's not the first time Trump has alluded to ending democracy in November. In previous speeches, he has warned of a violent rebellion if he does not win. Meanwhile, leaked documents have shown Trump's plan to essentially install a military dictatorship if he is elected.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
