The series included a number of iconic guest stars, including Natasha Bedingfield, Victoria Justice, and Dev Patel, among many others. Over the course of the show, True throws fashion shows, dates a character played by Robbie Amell, and even travels to Peru in the series finale.</p><p>In 2020, Palmer looked back on True as one of her most iconic characters, and she reflected that she was proud of how important the show was to a lot of people. "As I've gotten older, I didn't realize how much of an influence that character had on young Black women, young millennials, young kids, just everybody,"&nbsp;she told <a href=#>MTV News</a>.&nbsp;"Because it's like, yo, this is a young person living their dream."</p><p>After the show's cancellation, Palmer stuck with the Nickelodeon family. She went on to voice&nbsp;Aisha in more than a hundred episodes of Nick's "Winx Club"&nbsp;adaptation, and she also starred in a made-for-TV movie called "Rags" opposite other Nickelodeon stars like "Victorious"&nbsp;breakout Avan Jogia. She even hinted that a reboot of "True Jackson, VP"&nbsp;might be in the works in 2021, telling <a href=#>J-14</a>, "It was one of the most impactful times of my life in good ways and hard ways, but it was something that changed my life forever."&nbsp;She added,&nbsp;"I'm very grateful for it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxoZoF4e9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWainqOVYr2iuMyeqWaeoqS6bq%2FHoqOdoJ%2BksW7AzmZpcWWpmq6zv4yoo51n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-first-personal-comment-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton Wrote Her First Personal Instagram Comment</span></a>
