Edison was also a successful manufacturer who sold many of his inventions directly to the public.</p><p>In 1862, Edison saved a boy who was about to be hit by a boxcar. The father felt grateful and decided to teach Edison railroad telegraphy, and Edison started to work a few months later while he was doing scientific experiments (via <a href=#>Library of Congress</a>). According to <a href=#>National Park Service</a>, his first great <a href=#>invention</a> was the tin foil phonograph, which made him famous all over the globe. He became known as the "Wizard of Menlo Park." Edison was also invited to make a presentation of his phonograph in the White House in 1878.</p><p>Edison was a businessman ahead of his time, and he knew how to use the media in his favor. According to <a href=#>The Conversation</a>, Edison knew that newspapers could help him sell more products, and he often aimed to be in the headlines.</p><h2>Thomas Edison didn't invent the light bulb</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.grunge.com/img/gallery/thomas-edison-didnt-actually-invent-the-lightbulb-heres-why/thomas-edison-didnt-invent-the-light-bulb-1625667837.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Shutterstock</span><p>Edison might have held the patents for many inventions, but he didn't invent all of them alone. According to Ernest Freeberg, author of "<a href=#>The Age of Edison: Electric Light and the Invention of Modern America</a>," the light bulb was not invented by Edison. Freeberg explained in an interview that invention was "a very complex social process. He was in a very competitive race where he borrowed — some said stole — ideas from other inventors who were also working on the incandescent bulb" (via <a href=#>U.S. News and World Report</a>). The author adds that what made Edison successful was that he was not a solo inventor, but he created an inventor team at Menlo Park.</p><p>Although Edison created and utilized a team of inventors, he wasn't a fraud. According to <a href=#>The Conversation</a>, Edison changed the approach of invention and made it a competitive business. Besides an inventor, <a href=#>Edison</a> was also an ambitious businessman who not only helped develop motion pictures, but engaged in lengthy legal battles with other movie producers over patents and technology (per <a href=#>Library of Congress</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlG1vbGhfqbWwucCsZJ6cmai8r3nDopunrF2WsLXBwKWjsmWZo8OmutNmq6GdXaG2qLTTm6ylml2dsrOx0mauobFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-truth-about-donald-faisons-wife.html><span>←</span><span>The Truth About Donald Faison's Wife</span></a>
