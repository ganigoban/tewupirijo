"It's like, straight out of 'Downton Abbey,'" she told People. Schroeder also admitted that she was turning into "an a**hole the more it's on my finger" because she couldn't stop staring at the "big" rock she'd received. "I wake up and just stare at it. I really can't believe it," she&nbsp;told <a href=#>Refinery29</a> in August 2019. And yes, she also gushed about her ring to <a href=#>Bravo's The LookBook</a>. "Look how vintage and amazing it is," Schroeder said in 2019. "I feel like Meghan Markle or like someone out of 'Downton Abbey.' Like I am royalty right now. I can't believe that this is actually real. I get to wear this all the time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmhnaIV1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2owaK%2F0qJkrJuYp7ymsMSrqmadnpyuqLHMnqWtZaKeu6h7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-oral-b-toothbrushes-7360298.html><span>←</span><span>The 5 Best Oral-B Toothbrushes of 2024, Tested and Reviewed</span></a>
