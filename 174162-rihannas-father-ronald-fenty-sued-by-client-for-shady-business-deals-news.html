Back in January, it was reported that Rihanna was suing her father, accusing him of invasion of privacy, false advertising, and falsely using her name to promote his business, Fenty Entertainment. The court documents&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">claimed that the entertainment company</a> brandished its affiliation with the singer on its website and social media pages, even though she wasn't represented by them, nor did she have any association with the company.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The lawsuit went on to say that her father and his business partner Moses Perkins were using her name to rake in millions from others by lying to them. It reportedly states the two men “have egregiously and fraudulently misrepresented to third parties and the public that their company … is affiliated with Rihanna, and has the authority to act on her behalf. Mr. Fenty and Mr. Perkins have used these lies in a fraudulent effort to solicit millions of dollars from unsuspecting third parties in exchange for the false promise that they were authorized to act on Rihanna’s behalf, and/or that Rihanna would perform at various locations throughout the world.”</p><p>Jason Merritt/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now, a social media star by the name of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Harvey "Chef Henny" Justice</a> is suing Ronald and Fenty Entertainment, accusing them of exactly what Rihanna alluded to months ago. According to&nbsp;TMZ, Justice's lawyer Alex Spiro sent a legal letter to the entertainment company stating that Ronald told his client on multiple occasions that he represented Rihanna. For this reason, Justice agreed to be represented by the company and signed with them back in April 2018. However, there have been problems since then.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">publication also reports</a> that Justice claims Ronald promised him a $750,000 marketing budget, yet he only received $50,000. When Justice asked where the remained of the money is, he was told it was tied up with a South American investor. He's asking for what he was promised upon signing plus damages.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
