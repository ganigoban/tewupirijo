Like Billy, David has written several books about his relationship with the iconic singer, including <a href=#>"Life with Elvis,"</a> in which he describes his role as personal bodyguard for one of the world's most famous musicians. David was well recompensed by his step-brother for his work and lived a hedonistic lifestyle around his duties. Sadly, it all came crashing down in 1977 with the death of Elvis Presley, with David having the traumatic experience of discovering his step-brother's body.&nbsp;He later worked as a preacher&nbsp;and published his autobiography <a href=#>"Raised on Rock"</a> in 1996.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2022,&nbsp;David courted controversy for comments he made in the documentary "Elvis' Women" concerning Elvis' death, which he claimed was suicide. He also stated that his famous step-brother had a penchant for liaisons with underage girls, which David says he was disgusted by. However, after an outcry, David apologized and rescinded his bombshell claims.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available.
