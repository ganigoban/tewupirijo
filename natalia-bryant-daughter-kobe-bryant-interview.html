It's bittersweet, but I enjoy talking about him more than it's sad for me," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Natalia told several stories about how her father nurtured her interests growing up. The incoming film major said that her love of movies came from watching them with Kobe, who won an Academy Award for his animated short film, Dear Basketball. After a 2019 midnight showing of Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, the Los Angeles Lakers player agreed to watch all the franchise's films that same night with her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He was just like the best girl dad ever. He was just letting me play my playlist and jam out to Taylor Swift the whole ride back, and talk about Star Wars too. It was so much fun," she said, before admitting that the night did not go as planned. "I fell asleep during the first half of the [first] movie."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Natalia, who stands nearly six feet tall, also addressed her decision to play varsity volleyball in high school, admitting that she wasn't into basketball as a kid because she hates running.

You're going to love volleyball. I'm calling it right now.' I think [my mom] knew I wasn't confident in my height," she said. "She's like, 'You're going to play volleyball. You're going to get confident because of this. There are all these other tall girls too, so you're not the only one.'"<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite her love of the sport, Natalia decided not to play on her college team. "I quit volleyball after the accident because I was so ... a lot was going on at that time. I knew I didn't … love volleyball as much as they love basketball. I'm okay with that. […] I just wanted to take a break from it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked how her family is doing nowadays, the 18-year-old said that she and her mother are focusing on her little sisters, Bianka Bella, 4, and Capri Kobe, 2.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You do the best that you can.
