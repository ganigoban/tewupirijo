However, with a stunning coastline on their doorstep it's an ideal location away from the hustle and bustle of the city for fresh air and seaside walks.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5NiB0_R1Dq data-wc=29>That's not to say there aren't celebrities in the area. The Gilded Age mansion neighbors the likes of <a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, Conan O'Brien's vacation home and <a class=hm-link href=#>Judge Judy Sheindlin's home</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=emf37n1kceb data-wc=41>Jay and Mavis' curved compound has a tennis court, an infinity pool and a six-car garage, library, chef's kitchen and not to mention the private beaches. He opened up about their decision to buy the home during an interview with<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">&nbsp;Forbes</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3766fc905e49-gettyimages-468947177.jpg><p id=eKY8DO6f32 data-wc=59>"I wasn't planning on moving back east," he said. "I was with my wife, visiting family in Newport in October 2017. "I had my cousin with me and we were driving along and Mavis said,<strong>&nbsp;‘Look at that house. Look at that house. It is unbelievable.’</strong> And I said, ‘You’re right. It is unbelievable. It looks like a castle.’&nbsp;</p><p id=erbm32V1VlB data-wc=63>"So, I said to Mavis, ‘Do you want that house? Let’s see if it’s for sale.’ I turned the car around to go back to the house. Just as we drove by, the gate opened and the gardener came out. We all looked at each other and said, ‘The gate is opening. It’s a sign.’ So, I drove in and rang the bell.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=e7hzBt-Sff data-wc=51>"The caretaker answered and said, ‘You’re Jay Leno. Jay Leno!' Then I said, 'Hey, it's nice to meet you. Is this house for sale?' And the caretaker said the house was for sale but not listed currently. I asked if we could look around, and the guy gives me a tour.&nbsp;</p><p id=eF8Mh_SHtJ data-wc=66>"Then, I asked him to get the owner on the phone. "So, we get the owner on the phone, and I said<strong>, 'Will you sell the house as-is, with everything, all the furniture, the ketchup in the refrigerator, the salt shakers and just walk away?’&nbsp;</strong>And he said, 'Yeah, I'll walk away.' "We agreed on a price, and I bought it. We closed in 30 days."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=eGxsKlX4yd data-wc=41>Speaking of why he loves the area, Jay added: "Since I'm from the area, it's a great meeting place for all my relatives to come and have fun. They all get to stay there and it's great. I love the place."</p><p id=emABKTpiHv data-wc=31></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
