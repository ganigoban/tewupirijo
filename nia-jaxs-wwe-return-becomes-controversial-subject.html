Therefore, the Irresistible Force might have been trying to simply sandbag his reporting.</p><p>I stand by my report, and @NiaJaxWWE is welcome to provide me with another timeline if it’s false, as she claims. I’m guessing you also believed Dustin Runnels when he denied the report about no longer being under #WWE contract. #WorkersGonnaWork<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><br></a></p><p>It seems like Nia Jax’s return to WWE is now a matter of controversy. However, a double knee surgery isn’t to be taken lightly and the usual return time is around 7-9 months which could be longer considering her condition and occupation. Therefore, it really does stand to reason that she will be out until early 2020.</p><p>For what it’s worth <a href=#>Sean Sapp also reported</a> that it will be a long time before fans see Nia Jax in the ring again and if she’s lucky a Royal Rumble return could be possible.</p><p><a href=#>Nia Jax also claims that she is doing far better than her doctors expected.</a></p><p>At least this projected return timetable affords her a possible opportunity to work the Royal Rumble if they can make it happen or at least book Nia Jax to compete at WrestleMania in some form or fashion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
