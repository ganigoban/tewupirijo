"Since they are cold-blooded, their body temperature changes to match their environment, unlike warm-blooded humans where our body temperature is generally pretty constant. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on yahoo.com</a><h2>At what temperature do snakes not come out?</h2>As a general rule, snakes begin and end brumation at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

At cold temperatures, these reactions are slow and at warm temperatures they are fast. These chemical reactions are optimal at body temperatures are between 70 - 90 degrees Farenheit. Below 60 degrees Farenheit, snakes become sluggish. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What temperature do snakes like the most?</h2>The most important thing to remember is that reptiles are cold-blooded animals.
