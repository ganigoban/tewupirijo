The Portuguese authorities received considerable criticism after around 20 people walked into the crime scene, contaminating the crime scene, with one officer calling it the “worst preserved crime scene” he’d ever seen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b93850da4921-gettyimages-74112998.jpg><p id=eDZjMU7nOZ2 data-wc=61>After the room was searched for forensic evidence, it was surprisingly rented out again, with two families staying in the apartment throughout 2008. However, the apartment was listed by its owners soon afterwards for £250,000. Due to the circumstances in its sale, the apartment ultimately sold for less than half of the asking price to a British woman named Kathleen Macguire-Cotton.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e0e4dfeacc6e-gettyimages-74123970.jpg><p id=ej1KmYXi_nPf data-wc=76>She reportedly bought the apartment for £113,000 in 2017, and opened up about her thoughts on staying in the apartment. She told The Sun: “I’ve been offered money by the whole world [to visit the apartment] but I’m not interested. I don’t think that’s very fair to the McCann family or the people of Praia da Luz, upsetting everybody – it’s terrible. It happened a long time ago and I don’t have any opinions on it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=e6UK9Vr0ys6D data-wc=24>Kate opened up about discovering the moment that Madeleine was missing in her book,</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/85c79961d3e0-gettyimages-74414521.jpg><p id=e_6FSYekjw7K data-wc=44>She wrote: “When I realised Madeleine wasn't actually there, I went through to our bedroom to see if she'd got into our bed. That would explain the open (bedroom) door. On the discovery of another empty bed, the first wave of panic hit me.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why the prime suspect from Madeleine McCann’s disappearance might be released from prison" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/79bc0b24a646-madeleine-mccann-disappearance-timeline-what-happened-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why the prime suspect from Madeleine McCann’s disappearance might be released from prison" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why the prime suspect from Madeleine McCann’s disappearance might be released from prison</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="From Madeleine McCann and JonBénet Ramsey to O.J.
