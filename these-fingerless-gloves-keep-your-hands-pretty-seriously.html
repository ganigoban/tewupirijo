So anything we can do to keep ‘em looking young and fresh, apart from slathering on moisturizer and SPF (that’s key!) is interesting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These Skin Rejuvenating Gloves ($45; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>neimanmarcus.com</a>), from the beauty brand, iluminage, are formulated with copper-infused fibers that work to improve the texture and tone of your hands.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So think age spots, uneven skin tone, and fine lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The company says that copper is an ingredient that promotes the production of protein. It can be found in a ton of skin care products, as well as in the company’s uber-popular copper pillowcase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Considering all you really have to do is slip them on and go on your way, which Monday through Friday, for me, consists of a lot of typing on my computer, I was down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They have clinical trials that indicate the copper technology worked to improve the appearance of skin in about four weeks, which made me even more curious. Also, they seem like the most low-maintenance beauty treatment ever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I haven’t worn them for a month straight, I have started to test them out around the office. Here’s what I learned so far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They’re crazy comfortable, and after a while, you forget you have them on. Expect plenty of comments from those around you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And in that sense, they’re conversation starters!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You literally can do anything you did without them on — texting, typing, twirling your hair. (C’mon, I know that’s not only me).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They’re really soft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They make your average given day feel a little bit more special and take attention away from your chipped manicure. Score.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And for that, I am very willing to look like an ‘80s princess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMGpsdKeZJ%2Bhnpyys7jErKpmn5ykw6a%2FjKScnqhdrry2voyhmKeco2K9s7HTrbBmq5WntrDB0qWw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gena-colley-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gena Colley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
