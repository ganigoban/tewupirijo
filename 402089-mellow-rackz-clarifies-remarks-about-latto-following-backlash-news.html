Recently, Latto found herself at the center of controversy after she revealed that there was a bit of a hiccup with her album, 777, prior to its release.&nbsp;During an interview with Big Boy's Neighborhood, Latto stated that a man who was featured on the record was giving her a hard time clearing a song because she wouldn't answer his advances via DM. After she shared the tracklist, the public speculated that the person was <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a>. However, he repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Mellow Rackz, who allegedly dated Kodak,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">recently discussed Latto's plight</a> while on Rap Clout. "That's just life period. P*ssy runs the world...it's also the way you talk as a female. If you know you sexy as f*ck, don't show up to no studio meeting with a n*gga with your t*tties hanging out,"&nbsp;she said. "He not gay, put a jacket on and dress accordingly, don't tempt no n*gga."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Her comments ran wild on social media and just like that, Mellow Rackz was hit was a storm of backlash. She returned to her Instagram to clear up a few misconceptions about her remarks.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I wasn't addressing how She should have handled her situation which was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">totally different from mine</a>," Mellow wrote. "Realizing now, this question in this moment because this is more of a deeper conversational topic, not a quick 15 second soundbite. As a female working in a very male driven industry unfortunately we are always reminded to take certain precautions in order to achieve the same comfortability as our male counterparts."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She ended her message by saying that her decisions on how she&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">navigates her career,</a> and her comments about that, are about herself and no one else's situation.
