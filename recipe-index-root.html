I still can’t get behind white baked potatoes slathered with sour cream and butter, but I could&nbsp;eat these mega stuffed sweet potatoes for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Case in point, as I started writing&nbsp;this post, I went and polished off the leftovers I was saving for my lunch…&nbsp;for breakfast. I’m telling you, I have no self-control sometimes. A good stuffed sweet potato, of course, starts with the “stuff.” I made my filling by mixing black beans with corn, Cotija cheese, avocado, jalapeño, and generous squeezes of…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I made a lot of things with pumpkin over the&nbsp;weekend&nbsp;– not just because it’s the cliché fall food blogger thing to do, but because I roasted one&nbsp;pumpkin and cooked from it for days! It was the roasted pumpkin that kept on giving… I’ll admit that when it comes to pumpkin I often reach for a can, but the flavor and texture that come from a&nbsp;fresh pumpkin are really worth it. I made pumpkin hummus, pumpkin salad, pumpkin soup… and of course the&nbsp;pumpkin coconut red curry sauce that is pictured here. This sauce is rich and creamy, so to keep things…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Today, I’m taking a break from soup season (although I do have some good ones in the works!), because it’s been about 95 degrees lately&nbsp;and a big, cold noodle salad just sounded&nbsp;good to me.&nbsp;This bowl is full of whole grain noodles and crunchy veggies that are all tossed in a deliciously creamy, nutty tahini sauce. In&nbsp;an effort to feel some&nbsp;“fall spirit,” I roasted&nbsp;chickpeas and carrots and tossed those in too. Cooked carrots haven’t always been our thing – the trick is to roast them until they’re slightly tender but still have some bite (just don’t let them get mushy!). If…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Some exiting news – the book is done(!) and off to print this week.&nbsp;I’ll share some&nbsp;sneak peaks a little later but suffice it to say – I’m tired. I never thought I would say this but after shooting, testing, retesting, checking and rechecking so many&nbsp;recipes&nbsp;– I became a little “cooked” out.&nbsp;Over the last few weeks, while working through final copy and design edits, there’s been a lot of takeout around here and more than a few boxes of macaroni and cheese. But no one is complaining –&nbsp;especially not my mac & cheese-loving husband Jack. He would be more than thrilled…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Are you as excited as I am that it’s soup season? I love making a big batch of a soup or stew on Sunday and eating it all week. This butternut squash vegan chili recipe is my current Sunday soup obsession. It’s hearty and healthy, warming and slightly spicy.&nbsp;Plus, it’s one of those soups that gets a little better every day, so unlike most leftovers, I loved&nbsp;eating this chili for lunch just about every afternoon last week. Best Vegan Chili Recipe Ingredients To make this vegan chili recipe hearty & flavorful, I added butternut squash. It gives the chili bulk…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>And just like that, it’s squash season again! Admittedly, until last year, spaghetti squash was not&nbsp;my favorite. I think butternut gets all the fall glory and poor spaghetti squash, well, it’s just inaccurately named. The name implies that you can sauce it up and twirl it with a fork – and if that’s what you’re craving, maybe go check out one of these recipes. If you’re up for roasted squash strands fluffed up with a fork and stuffed with delicious things, then keep reading! I had this small-ish spaghetti squash that was the perfect size to serve as “bowls” for…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This is my new favorite salad… and I don’t throw words like “favorite” or “best ever” around lightly. You may have noticed that I love roasted sweet potatoes in just about any salad (as evident here,&nbsp;here, and here) but this combination – with roasted tomatoes, roasted apples, corn, and a tangy/smoky chipotle dressing – was so good that I made it for dinner two nights in a row. The first night, I made this as&nbsp;a lazy-girl dinner. Jack was out of town so&nbsp;for an easy “by myself” dinner I decided&nbsp;to roast&nbsp;the things (pictured above) that had just arrived&nbsp;in my&nbsp;Farmhouse Delivery…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Hold your pumpkin bread – I have one last&nbsp;super summery recipe before this season really ends. You can use any summer squash you like here&nbsp;(zucchini or yellow squash are both great), but I found pattypan squash at the farmers market and had to try it! I considered making a totally different pattypan squash recipe by stuffing and baking it, but I didn’t want to turn the oven on. Then I noticed that I had some really stale bread, so this hearty, delicious pattypan squash panzanella was an obvious choice. I’m a HUGE fan of panzanellas, or Italian bread salads (see…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy holiday weekend!&nbsp;If you’re hosting a cookout this Labor Day weekend, here are a&nbsp;few&nbsp;simple (yet super delicious!) veggie recipe ideas. And if you’re attending a cookout this weekend –&nbsp;well, it’s always good to be a bringer&nbsp;especially if you’re the one with the special food requirements. (Who me?) Ok, let’s get started – first we’re going to&nbsp;load up some skewers. (Actually, first, we’re going to make some margaritas). Once you have a&nbsp;drink in hand, get started by marinating the mushrooms. My secret not-so-secret-anymore marinade is so easy – &nbsp;olive oil, balsamic, soy sauce and black pepper. The mushrooms become deeply browned&nbsp;and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Stuffed peppers are one of my go-to summer dinners. In fact, they’re so easy that when I posted this picture on Instagram&nbsp;last week,&nbsp;I got tons of&nbsp;emails asking for the fully measured recipe. Ask and you shall receive, so here it is: my current favorite recipe for vegetarian stuffed peppers. But don’t let the measurements fool you – feel free to eyeball your ingredients&nbsp;if you don’t feel like breaking out the measuring cups. This vegetarian stuffed peppers recipe is simple and customizable! If you don’t have orzo, use couscous. Gluten-free? Millet or quinoa would also work well in place of the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In my opinion, the world cannot have too many quinoa salads. Don’t get me wrong, I love the other grains too – farro, millet, and wheatberries are all lovely – but my real go-to grain is&nbsp;quinoa. I love to make a big batch and keep it on hand, as it’s the perfect&nbsp;catch-all for the vegetables, nuts, and cheeses that I usually have around. Of course, since this salad was destined for a picnic without any silverware, I decided to have my cake (salad?) and eat it too&nbsp;by stuffing it in a veggie wrap.
