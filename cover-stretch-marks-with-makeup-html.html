Inputs from L'oreal Paris USA.</p><p><b>Colour correct</b></p><p>Using the colour wheel you learned about back in elementary school, you can easily neutralise any unwanted tones on your hair or skin. When it comes to covering stretch marks, it's important to consider their tone. If they're new and purplish, you'll want to use a yellow colour corrector to cancel out the color of the stretch marks.</p><p>If your stretch marks are older, you may not need to colour or correct them as they're likely already flesh-toned, albeit lighter than the rest of your skin.</p><p><b>Use full-coverage foundation</b></p><p>Of course, a full-coverage foundation is essential for covering stretch marks. Choose a full-coverage formula that contains high-load pigments and can cover everything from scars to hyperpigmentation.</p><p><b>Set your makeup</b></p><p>After expertly covering your stretch marks, you wouldn't want your makeup to budge throughout the day. To keep everything in place and get an extra boost of coverage, use a fluffy powder brush to sweep on a setting powder.</p><p><b>Apply self-tanner</b></p><p>While not makeup, self-tanner is a holy grail beauty product that can help disguise the look of stretch marks. Not to mention, you'll get the appearance of beautifully bronzed skin in the process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueZpudkarBunnAp5tmnpGotaq7zWhpaWpgZH1ze5FsZpynppq%2Fbr%2FTq5ytm5hiuqK%2ByqxksKGknXqurcqerKlmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-cant-you-throw-ashes-in-the-ocean.html><span>←</span><span>Why can't you throw ashes in the ocean?</span></a>
