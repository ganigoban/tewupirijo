The low-key, eccentric, and melodic rapper <a href=# class=text-word rel>Smino</a> has just announced his next album, "Luv 4 Rent," will be dropping on October 28th and has released the album's cover art via social media. The cover depicts Smino fixing his afro alongside other colleagues in the middle of a garden. It seems serene, tongue-in-cheek, and exactly the mix of personality and aesthetic that we've come to expect from the St. Louis MC.</p><p>Smino performs on December 05, 2019 in Miami, Florida - Craig Barritt/Getty Images</p><p>The "Wild Irish Roses" star had already garnered plenty of buzz thanks to a hot new single with <a href=# class=text-word rel>J. Cole</a>, "<a href=# rel>90 Proof,</a>" that dropped last month. He also announced a joint tour with J.I.D, as they seemingly solidify themselves as two of the best rappers working today. By the time "Luv 4 Rent" arrives, both will have dropped big return projects, and we're sure that Smino's offerings will bring acclaim to him much like The Forever Story showered J.I.D with praise this year.</p><p>It's also not the first time fans have been teased with this new album in particular, with Smino sharing its title as early as last December. Amid a slew of<a href=# rel> features </a>this year, he also dropped the<a href=# rel> music video for his Kobe tribute</a> "24-8."</p><p>Smino might not be the most chart-heavy or mainstream rising star of the moment, but he's certainly one of the hardest-working. More than five years after his breakout project blkswn, and after years of mixtapes and hustling, Smino's stayed in the rap game's mind as a consistent talent to watch for.</p><p>Stay tuned to HotNewHipHop for the latest on "Luv 4 Rent" and check out some tour dates where you can catch Smino and J.I.D below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaX9yfJdmqqahnqR6pb7Oqapmm5%2BrsrN5wKurZp6fp3qvsdZmmKWapaJ6rcHVZmtmqpWjwQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./difference-between-size-inclusive-vs-plus-size.html><span>←</span><span>Size Inclusive vs Plus Size: What's the Difference?</span></a>
