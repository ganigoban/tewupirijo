He was 82.</p><p>His family <a href=# rel=nofollow>announced</a> on BillyJack.com that Laughlin died Thursday “at sunset” near his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths of 2013</a></strong></p><p>In the four Billy Jack movies, Laughlin played the main character — a mystical half-breed ex-Green Beret hero with martial-arts skills — opposite his wife, <strong>Delores Taylor</strong>, who portrayed a schoolteacher.</p><p>The couple teamed on screenplays, and he directed all four films. Themes explored included child abuse, religious persecution and exploitation of the Native American.&nbsp;</p><p>An activist in real life, Laughlin ran for U.S. president in 1992, 2004 and 2008.</p><p>The Billy Jack series started with Born Losers (1967), in which Laughlin’s character battles a motorcycle gang that terrorizes and rapes women in a California beach town.</p><p>In Billy Jack (1971), Laughlin defends a hippie-themed school, stands up for Native American schoolchildren and kills a man for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. After three studios fell off the film, Laughlin sued and arranged distribution on his own. Billy Jack grossed more than $40 million in a rerelease, one of the most successful independent films of its time.</p><p>The Trial of Billy Jack (1974) finds our hero in and out of prison and is marked by a bloody finale meant to reflect on the campus-shooting incidents of the day, like the one at Kent State in 1970. And in Billy Jack Goes to Washington (1977), which never made it to theaters, Jack is appointed a U.S. senator.</p><p>A fifth film, The Return of Billy Jack, was started in the mid-1980s but never finished.</p><p>Laughlin also wrote, produced and starred in The Master Gunfighter (1975), with the actor freeing Native Americans during the California mission period. And he had a role in the London-set 1978 version of The Big Sleep, directed by <strong>Michael Winner </strong>and starring <strong>Robert Mitchum</strong>.</p><p>Earlier, Laughlin had the lead in The Delinquents (1957), the first dramatic feature directed by <strong>Robert Altman</strong>.</p><p>A native of Milwaukee, Laughlin attended several colleges, for whom he played football. He made his onscreen debut in a 1955 episode of Climax!, appeared on&nbsp;The Millionaire and other shows and was in the films South Pacific (1958) and Gidget (1959).</p><p>Laughlin and Taylor, who survives him, were married for 60 years. Survivors also include their children,&nbsp;<strong>Frank</strong>, <strong>Teresa</strong> and <strong>Christina</strong> (they also were involved in the Billy Jack films), and five grandchildren.</p><p>Services were not announced. In lieu of flowers or gifts, the family asks that donations be made to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Friends of Pine Ridge</a> or the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Alzheimer’s Foundation of America</a>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKO1y6WwZqKRmLhuv9OaqWasn6J6ra3UoJ%2BloZ5ig3eBl2tuaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./betty-vazquez-net-worth-267038.html><span>←</span><span>Betty Vazquez Net Worth</span></a>
