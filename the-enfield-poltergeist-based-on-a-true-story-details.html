So how much of it is real? Here’s what we know…&nbsp;</p><h3>Is the Enfield Poltergeist a true story?&nbsp;</h3><p id=e5AFMU67-_y data-wc=57>Whether there really was a spirit haunting home in London, it is undeniable that the alleged poltergeist did indeed dominate headlines back in 1977 after the Hodgson family, who lived in the house at the time, claimed that there was a spirit in the house who was particularly focused on their two children, sisters Janet and Margaret.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The Enfield Poltergeist is based on a true story</figure><p id=e3KrDFMBbuk data-wc=39>Maurice Grosse was a paranormal investigator who captured recordings of the house, which are set to be used in the show, and claimed that he believed the hauntings to be real, despite his peers being incredulous at the time."&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1da633a350f9-theenfieldpoltergeistphoto010401jpgphotomodalshowhomelarge2x.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow">WATCH THE ENFIELD POLTERGEIST HERE</a><p id=eOhagY9Gbc8 data-wc=49>Daily Mirror photographer Graham Morris also believed in the entity after photographing the property during the media storm, telling Sky News: "Up to 18 months I spent on and off in that house and saw so, so much happen, from the first night being hit by that Lego brick."&nbsp;</p><p id=ewuSr79rJ8qu data-wc=34>He added: "So, so much happened. It would have been impossible for the girls or any member of the family to have done it. It's just too much. It was constant, it was relentless."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a5af9c4d638-theenfieldpoltergeistphoto010302.jpg><p id=ejEAVmKSLdYH data-wc=47>Apple TV’s synopsis reads: "The mysterious case forever changed ideas about the supernatural, and showed that it wasn’t just restricted to castles and stately homes but could be experienced by anyone, anywhere." The historical tale has also inspired a TV show, two plays and The Conjuring 2.&nbsp;</p><h3>Is The Enfield Poltergeist a fictionalised documentary?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eEdwNdd-e04B data-wc=59>The documentary will showcase a combination of over 250 hours of real audio footage while recreating the home and the family, reconstructing the true testimonies from those involved in the case with actors for a unique spin on a documentary. As such, production built a replica of the hour, while performers reenacted what is heard on the tapes.

One is our way into the series, which is through Maurice Grosse and through the outsider coming into the house, and the other is what's happening for that family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a8a29103e6d0-theenfieldpoltergeistphoto010301.jpg><p id=eXT1BeBh35ui data-wc=80>"These were like a set of really traumatic events that happened, particularly to Janet and Margaret at the centre of the story as teenagers. Those events will certainly have shaped aspects of their lives ever since, particularly because of the media interest in it …it felt important to work really closely with them, and towards the end of the series, they come into the series as adults, and we learn about the legacy and their sense of those events now."</p><p id=ebgt85JqNCCC data-wc=55>Janet and Margaret previously returned to the house in 2016 when The Conjuring 2 was being released, with Janet saying: "It is very strange being back, it brings back a lot of memories.
