Church, who has built his career as a <a href=#>country singer</a>, met Blasingame, a music publisher, more than a decade ago when they were both in Nashville. Church told <a href=#>Taste of Country</a> in 2012, a few years after they'd first crossed paths, that his initial meeting with Blasingame was happenstance. "She was trying to hook me up to write with one of her writers that she represented, that was how we met," he said.</p><p>Instead of pursuing a professional relationship together, the two fell in love. Church (whose real name is Kenneth Eric Church) and Blasingame got married on Jan. 8, 2008 in North Carolina, Church's home state. He even wrote a song for his bride for their wedding called&nbsp;<a href=#>"You Make It Look So Easy."</a></p><p>"There was one on the Carolina record called 'You Make It Look So Easy,' which I wrote for our wedding — by myself. That song was 100% about it," he told Taste of Country. He added, according to <a href=#>The Boot</a>, that he doesn't enjoy love songs because he thinks they're cliche. Instead, he went his own route. "At the wedding is the first time Katherine really heard the whole thing. She cried. Everybody cried," he said. "That's me baring my soul, there."</p><h2>Eric Church and Katherine Blasingame are parents to two boys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/inside-eric-churchs-marriage-to-katherine-blasingame/eric-church-and-katherine-blasingame-are-parents-to-two-boys-1600013674.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Christopher Polk/Getty Images</span><p>Since then, Eric Church and Katherine Blasingame have become a true team. They're parents to two boys, Boone and Hawk, who were born in 2011 and 2015.&nbsp;As a music publisher, Blasingame has been able to provide a unique kind of professional feedback for Church, too. "It's great now, because being a publisher and being somebody in the industry, I can bounce songs off of her and she has the knowledge, you know, to be kind of that sounding board of what I should cut and what I shouldn't cut. So, she's one of those in the inner circle that I run a lot of stuff by," he told <a href=#>Taste of Country</a> in 2012.</p><p>Church's life as a multi-platinum country artist is obviously quite busy, but&nbsp;Blasingame has been there for all the ups and the downs. She helped Church through&nbsp;<a href=#>losing his brother</a> in 2018 and nearly dying himself from a blood clot a few years ago.&nbsp;The couple is sure to make time for each other for the happy things, though.</p><p>"My wife loves horses, so sometimes I'll get on a horse and go riding with her,"&nbsp;Church told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in 2016.&nbsp;"I am not a horse person, but I'll do it just to be with her for a little bit... She stays with me on the road. With kids, it's hard, but we just try to find a quiet spot together, somewhere, sometime, and that's usually enough."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xmaIZ4e8inqqKclWKys7XCZpqhraKYtbR5zJqpq6GRnLJuwM5mopqsmJq%2FqrrEZpmlmaOeu6itzJ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-long-do-lash-extensions-last.html><span>←</span><span>How Long Do Lash Extensions Last</span></a>
