And like many great inventors, finding solutions to her own problems led to the creation of new products — even her own line. Because other Black women had similar hair issues and found her products helpful, Walker was making quite a lot of money. She widened her market when she moved to Denver to bank on the effects that the region's drier climate had on the hair of Black women there. She also met a man named C.J. Walker and they wed. She took his name and that is how she became Madam C.J. Walker. She would go on to enjoy the successes of her entrepreneurship, and even opened a beauty school in Indiana, per <a href=#>Indiana History</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>There are countless photos of Walker available on the internet, particularly one of her famously driving with friends in her luxury car, (via <a href=#>New York Public Library</a>). But her most recognized photo is that of her profile. Here, the photo has been colorized, offering us a more modern glimpse of what the famous entrepreneur looked like.</p><p dir=ltr>The color version makes it obvious Walker was wearing some makeup. Her cheeks are slightly rosy and her lips are a shade of pink. Walker's top is covered by what looks like a detailed light-colored top or dress, and she is wearing what looks to be gold earrings and necklace. All in all, she looks regal and powerful — a fitting image for a pioneering businesswoman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCk21ta2lfqbWqv4ycpqWnop7HprCMqZ%2BorJ9ixKq4y2aaoZmenLJutM6wZLKnpWK5sLvKZpitZZ2WsaK5jJxko2WnlrmssdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-meaning-behind-tik-tok-by-keha.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Meaning Behind &amp;quot;TiK ToK&amp;quot; By Ke$ha</span></a>
