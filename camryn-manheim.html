In 1999, she won the&nbsp;Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series&nbsp;for her work on&nbsp;The Practice, and she was awarded the&nbsp;Women in Film&nbsp;Lucy Award. In 2005, she earned&nbsp;Golden Globe and&nbsp;Emmy&nbsp;nominations for her work in the miniseries&nbsp;Elvis. Her breakthrough was her one-woman show "Wake Up, I'm Fat", which played&nbsp;off-Broadway&nbsp;at&nbsp;Classic Stage Company&nbsp;in 1994.&nbsp;She adapted the show into a book of the same name, which was published by&nbsp;Broadway Books&nbsp;in 1999. She worked for a while as a&nbsp;sign language&nbsp;interpreter at hospitals.&nbsp;Her knowledge of sign language was used on&nbsp;The Practice, in an episode of&nbsp;Law & Order, and in her role as a child behavioral psychologist in the movie&nbsp;Mercury Rising. In 2015, Manheim was in the Deaf West production of the musical&nbsp;Spring Awakening&nbsp;as Adult Women. The production, which had a cast composed half of hearing actors and half of deaf or hard-of-hearing actors, paired every deaf actor (who signed their lines in&nbsp;American Sign Language) with a hearing actor who said their lines verbally. Manheim voiced for deaf actress&nbsp;Marlee Matlin&nbsp;as well as signing her own dialogue in the parts of Frau Bergmann, Fräulein Großebüstenhalter, and Fräulein Knuppeldick. Her other television credits include&nbsp;Chicago Hope,&nbsp;Ally McBeal,&nbsp;Family Guy,&nbsp;Will & Grace,&nbsp;Boston Public,&nbsp;Two and a Half Men,&nbsp;The L Word,&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother, and Hannah Montana. Since 2022, she has been part of the main cast of&nbsp;the revival of&nbsp;Law & Order. Her film credits include&nbsp;Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,&nbsp;The Laramie Project,&nbsp;Scary Movie 3,&nbsp;Dark Water,&nbsp;and&nbsp;An Unfinished Life. In August 2019, she was elected secretary-treasurer of the&nbsp;SAG-AFTRA union. Manheim was elected to the secretary-treasurer position. She did not run for reelection in 2021, and was succeeded by&nbsp;Joely Fisher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXCmqqtZpmkfLWty56lrWeTlrqzxc1mpJqmmJq2rg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./camilla-sparv-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Camilla Sparv Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
