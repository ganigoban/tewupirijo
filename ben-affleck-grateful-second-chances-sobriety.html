Magazine" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">WSJ. Magazine</a>, the Gone Girl actor candidly reflected on his personal journey toward overcoming alcoholism and the lessons that got him to where he is today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There's a lot that I would want my younger self to understand. Some things, honestly, that I'm too self-conscious of or shy about to be really candid about with the whole world because they're mostly mistakes," Affleck told the outlet, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/ben-affleck-feels-grateful-for-difficulties/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>. "Things I wish I had done differently, and they're rooted in that instinct to look at my past and think, I wish I could have avoided this painful event. I wish I could have not caused someone else pain. I wish I had understood better the nature of what was difficult about life for me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He added that, though he wishes he "did not have to learn some lessons the hard way," the "difficulties" of alcoholism helped him "learn those things in an authentic, meaningful way to really learn the lessons that I've really internalized, that have created the values that I have now even though most of them were born of failure."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continued, "The only real cure for alcoholism is suffering. You just hope that your threshold for suffering is met somewhere before it destroys your life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Personally, his attitude toward life's hard lessons has evolved in the past few years. "I used to be irritated by people who would say, 'Oh, I have these problems and I'm grateful for them.' I used to think, 'This is bulls---. You're not grateful for disasters, creating pain and wreckage in your life. Say you feel s----- about it and you wish you were better!'" said the Oscar-winning actor. "Only within the last five years, I really felt increasingly grateful for the difficulties that I've had. … It's not insignificant, because a lot of that pain is rooted in pain caused to other people. And that turns out to be the most painful thing in life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, Affleck, who earlier this year reunited with his former fiancée Jennifer Lopez, is happy to get a "second chance."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Life is difficult, and we are always failing and hopefully learning from those failures," he explained. "The one thing you really need to avail yourself of the opportunities provided from that growth is the second chance. I've definitely tried to take advantage of that. I haven't always been successful, but in cases in which I have, they've turned out to be the defining aspects of my life."</p><img alt='"the last duel" red carpet the 78th venice international film festival' title='"The Last Duel" Red Carpet - The 78th Venice International Film Festival' width=3772 height=2515 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-attend-the-red-carpet-of-the-news-photo-1638382303.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Pascal Le Segretain</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Affleck and Lopez attend the premiere of The Last Duel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Affleck was previously married to Jennifer Garner, with whom he shares three kids: Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel Affleck. He and Garner divorced in 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actor has opened up about struggling with alcoholism before. In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.yahoo.com/now/ben-affleck-why-drank-something-193621554.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a> last year, he shared, "When my life got stressful, which principally had to do with the disappointment and the pain that the divorce caused my children, that affected me profoundly." He continued, "I didn't want to see them hurt. I found myself drinking more and more at night at home by myself. It was something I was doing to avoid dealing with painful feelings. My parents got divorced when I was young. I know how painful that is."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
