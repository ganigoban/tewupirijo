The It Is What It Is host wore jeans in which Melyssa Ford's face was prominently displayed on the crotch. The fashion statement came as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jermaine Dupri</a> joined Cam'ron live in studio while Ma$e co-hosted remotely.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The most recent chapter in the beef between Killa and Ford came in December, when Cam'ron went after <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joe Budden</a> for defending Ford. "Ohh she's an expensive escort? How much bro?" Cam'ron wrote over a clip of Budden's defense. "Looking bad and sad! This wasn't a wise decision! Move on y'all best bet," the rapper also wrote as a caption for his post.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Melyssa Ford and Cam'ron have been feuding for several weeks now. It all started when Ford was commented on a wild story that he told on It Is What It Is at the end of November. “Well, we was gangbanging b-tches. I remember one time — don’t let me talk about the past — we was at this whore house, me and Murda. So we left the b-tch out the wh-re house. I had a lil’ stash crib over there between 7th and Lennox and we brought this b-tch over there," Cam'ron began beside a mortified Ma$e.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Killa was far from finished. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Mase</a> was on the way up, he was popping, he didn’t have his deal but it was about to happen. We so Harlem the b-tch sucked — pardon me ladies — sucking his d-ck so I gotta wait to get my d-ck sucked because I’m not hard yet, pause. So when he’s done hitting it I go get head. And he’s hitting it from the back. He started hitting her, ‘You wasn’t sucking my d-ck like that.’ Yeah, that’s my n-gga," Cam'ron continued After Ford slammed the story, the rapper hit back, threatening to get her deported. He also went after Joe Budden after Budden defended his co-host.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnan94hZBmmpqloqS7brnEpbCsq5Fis7C%2Bw2ahnpmeqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brussels-sprout-avocado-salad.html><span>←</span><span>Brussels Sprout, Broccoli &amp;amp; Avocado Rice</span></a>
