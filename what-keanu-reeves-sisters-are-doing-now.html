Staying away from the spotlight, she doesn't have much of a relationship with her famous brother. Speaking to The Mirror (via <a href=#>Whoa Is (Not) Me</a>) in 2003, Emma Rose explained, "I would love to have a relationship with Keanu," adding, "I don't want anything from him — not money, not fame by association — just to get to know my big brother. I see all his films and read all the articles about him, but it's not the same as being part of his life."</p><p>Keanu's relationship on his dad's side has always been strained. In 2001, Samuel spoke to the <a href=#>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</a>, explaining how his substance abuse created a rift between himself and his A-list son. "He's made it clear that he wants nothing to do with me. My feeling was so intense that it told me how much I missed the kid. It's been so long for everything."</p><p>Samuel Reeves <a href=#>passed away in 2018</a>, but it seems like that hasn't changed much in terms of&nbsp;Keanu's relationship with his half-sister. According to The Victor O'Hana Facebook page (via <a href=#>Mr.-Reeves.com</a>), Emma Rose hosted a memorial luncheon in light of Samuel Reeves' passing, but none of her father's other children were in attendance.</p><p>If you were shocked to learn that Reeves has multiple siblings, you'll never believe <a href=#>what else you don't know about the actor's life</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9pZYJ3e9ahmK1lm5qur8GMq5yerpWoerS10q2cq6tdlr%2BmecOooKefXaO8uHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vegan-burrito.html><span>←</span><span>Vegan Burrito</span></a>
