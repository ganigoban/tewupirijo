So never losing sight of the fact that you're only two wins in a row from being the hottest player on the planet, that's a funny thing in our game. I think maybe wins are maybe a little overweighted as far as how good a golf you're playing on a week-to-week basis, but that's the name of the game in our sport, it's how many wins an what tournaments did you win.</p><p>“My game's in a really good spot. I've been trying to double down on the process that got me to where I am, not change a whole lot and just look for small incremental improvements and I think the consistent play I've had this year is a testament to that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaKaVrMBwvMCtqaKbm2KworrTpZiyZZlisbC602afmq6VYq6vxYypo5qmo2LBsHnJqKCnZZyew26txa2cq2WWmrGmxIycrKk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mushoku-tensei-jobless-reincarnation-2-release-date-and-time-where-to-watch-countdown-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mushoku Tensei Jobless Reincarnation 2: Release Date and Time, Where To Watch, Countdown</span></a>
