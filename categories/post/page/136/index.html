[Chorus]
My eyes bleed
I don‚Äôt cry no more
The pain that spills is tainted, filled with my sorrows
And when I speak
My words right my wrongs
I pray one day the pain will stay inside these songs

That was the best day I had
Every day since back then
I can‚Äôt get you off my head
Every thought, every step</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Margot Robbies Golden Globes Manicure Included This $10 Polish</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>
