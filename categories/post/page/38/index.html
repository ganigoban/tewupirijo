Baby, see how I been living
Velvet curtains on the windwos to
Keep the bright and unforgiving
Light from shining throughBaby, I remember all the things we did
When we slept together
In the blue behind your eyelids

Traced your scent through the gloom
'Til I found these purple flowers
I was spent, I was soon smelling you for hours
Lavender, lotus blossoms too
Water the dirt, flowers last for you</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Netflix: Who is Cas Holman? Meet the Abstract: Art of Design star on Instagram! Thu 26 Septembe</h2><time>Sep 3, 2024</time>
