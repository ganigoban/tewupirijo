Answer
The engine will need roughly 18-22 ounces of oil to run properly. Most of the time, I will put in 18ounces and then check the dipstick from there and continue to add till the container is full. If your model does not have a dipstick, you may fill the tank with 20 ounces of oil, which should be plenty.
