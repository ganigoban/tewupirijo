Time to rewind
Back to 1995 when we were nothing
Walking through the streets of Boston no one listening
No one caring about the empty rooms we played
Until they all showed up one for one day
Then we turned our stage and everything changedTurn that shit out louder! Make it all go faster! Playing through the witching hour! Take it to one thousand horsepower! Under lights now
Playing to the masses everything feels right</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Merle Haggard Me and Crippled Sol</h2><time>Sep 9, 2024</time>

Now that it's alright to burn the stars and stripes
Yes, nobody really needs old Uncle Sam
Might as well burn the bill of rights as well
And let our country go straight to hell
Only me and crippled soldiers give a damnShould they throw away their purple hearts and hide their uniforms
And be proud to hear old glories on the ground
Somebody said, they'd take us without firing a shot</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Princess Kylie Jenner looks more Marilyn Monroe than Kim in jaw-dropping gown Sat 3</h2><time>Sep 9, 2024</time>
