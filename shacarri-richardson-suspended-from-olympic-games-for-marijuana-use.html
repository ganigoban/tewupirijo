Richardson's Olympic qualifying results have been disqualified, and she has accepted a one-month period of ineligibility that began June 28.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Richardson became the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36789007/shacarri-richardson-is-now-the-fastest-woman-in-america/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fastest woman in America" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">fastest woman in America</a> after she ran the 100-meter heat in 10.61 seconds at the trials in Eugene, Oregon. Though marijuana is legal in the state, as well as 19 other states, Washington D.C., and Guam, marijuana is considered a banned substance of abuse by the World Anti-Doping Agency and U.S. Track and Field.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Richardson told TODAY that the loss of her biological mother the week before the trials played a part in her marijuana use. Richardson learned about her mother's death from a reporter during a media appearance days before the trials. She that hearing the news from a complete stranger was "nerve-shocking."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"(I'm) not making an excuse or looking for any empathy in my case, but, however, being in that position in my life, finding out something like that, something that I would say is probably one of the biggest things that have impacted me ... that definitely was a very heavy topic on me," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Richardson's suspension for using a non-addictive, legal substance that likely had little to no effect on her race performance is devastating. It's also heartbreaking that Richardson now has to relive her pain over her mother's death and share it with the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"People don’t understand what it’s like to have to … go in front of the world and put on a face and hide my pain. Who am I to tell you how to cope when you’re dealing with the pain or you’re dealing with a struggle that you haven’t experienced before or that you thought you never would have to deal with?" she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Richardson also referenced a Tweet she posted yesterday which simply said, "I am human."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Don’t judge me because I am human. I’m you, I just happen to run a little faster," she said on TODAY.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Richardson's suspension is another example of the demands that sports competition organizers put on athletes, while forgetting that the champions are still human. It's also another instance, soon after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a36687625/naomi-osaka-and-the-cost-of-saying-no/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Naomi Osaka's withdrawal" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Naomi Osaka's withdrawal</a> from the French Open, that shows that the mental health of Black athletes needs to be more of a priority in professional sports.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 21-year-old said that, though there is still a chance she can compete in other races, right now she'd focusing on healing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Right now, I’m just putting all of my time and energy into dealing with what I need to do, which is heal myself. So if I’m allowed to receive that blessing, then I’m grateful for it, but if not, right now I’m going to just focus on myself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also apologized to her supporters, saying that she struggled to deal with her emotions. "I greatly apologize if I let you guys down, and I did."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here's hoping that Sha'Carri will still be able to compete this year.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
