<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Elton John Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Elton John, a British singer, composer, pianist, and songwriter, is extremely well-known and successful. Elton John’s net worth is $500 million as of this writing. He has managed to create the most commercially successful collection of songs and music of any musician. His albums have so far sold more than&nbsp;300 million copies.</p><p>He surpasses <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.lolwot.com/madonna-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Madonna</a>, <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.lolwot.com/michael-jackson-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Jackson</a>, Elvis, and The Beatles with those sales and&nbsp;ranks&nbsp;as the fifth-best-selling artist in the annals of modern music. He consistently makes the list of the top 10 highest-paid celebrities in the world. Elton made more than $80 million in a year of touring through his many different investments and businesses.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=elton-john-his-early-life><strong>Elton John – His Early Life</strong></h2><p>The young Reginald Dwight, born on March 25, 1947, began playing the piano in Middlesex, England, at his grandmother’s home. He was only 3 then and 4 years later began formal piano lessons. He attended Pinner Wood Junior School, where his talent was obvious early on. And, at age 11, he won a sought-after scholarship to the prestigious Royal Academy of Music in London.</p><p>Rather than follow his father’s advice and pursue a career in banking, Reginald continued on his musical path, landing a gig playing the piano at a local venue while only 15 years old, thanks to his step-father. His parents, Sheila Dwight and Stanley Dwight were divorced, and his mother later married Fred Farebrother, who provided a loving and supportive presence in Reginald’s life.</p><p>In 1966, Reginald and a few friends formed a band named Bluesology. His long-time friend and collaborator, songwriter Bernie Turpin arrived in his life and, together with the newly renamed Elton John, became the sensational duo who have created more than 30 albums.</p><p>Despite his initial success in the USA, Elton still lived in the flat he shared with his parents.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=eltons-career-and-rise-to-stardom><strong>Elton’s Career and Rise to Stardom</strong></h2><p>The duo worked at DJM records, writing songs for many other musicians, and as 1968 rolled into 1969, their Empty Sky album hit the charts. &nbsp;This was Elton’s first major achievement and was followed in 1970 by the hit album, “Elton John.” It hit the Billboard 200 charts at number 4, and the songwriting team was on their way to stardom.</p><p>Elton’s first number 1 hit in the US, “Honky Château,” debuted in 1972. It was followed by Crocodile Rock, which hit the US Billboard 100 charts, and then “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” arrived in 1973 to universal acclaim. Such was the success that Elton John established The Rocket Record Company, his very own record label. He was joined by fellow founders Bernie Taupin, Steve Brown, and Gus Dudgeon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/kremlin-confirms-that-putin-will-actually-meet-elton-john-1024x512.jpg><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=elton-johns-net-worth><strong>Elton John’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>A key factor in Elton John’s increasing net worth was his decision to release his music under his own label. Turning down a deal with MCA, Elton John continued producing many hit albums throughout the 1970s, 1980’2, and 1990s.</p><p>The 12-year contract signed with Warner Brothers in 1992 for $39 Million was the highest cash advance paid to a singer in history. The collaboration paid off, as in 1994, he garnered the Grammy Awards title for&nbsp;Best Song from the Lion King. Fifteen million copies were sold worldwide.</p><p>This was followed by the re-release of his 1973 classic song “Candle in the Wind” in 1997. This tribute he paid to Diana, Princess of Wales, who tragically passed away following a motor vehicle accident. The song went on to amass huge sales worldwide, ending as the all-time best-selling single. Elton John earned his one and only Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Recording for this song.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=elton-johns-worldwide-assets><strong>Elton John’s Worldwide Assets</strong></h2><p>Elton’s net worth has increased&nbsp;by being one of the most well-paid performers and through his smart contract negotiations and a business-centered approach to his career.</p><p>He has negotiated deals that include the Million Dollar Piano in a Las Vegas residency that netted him a percentage of the ticket sales. That translated into a considerable monthly income, as&nbsp;Elton John earns more&nbsp;than $500,000 per show, adding considerably to his net worth.</p><p>He is known to love art, with Elton John’s&nbsp;art collection rumored to be worth as much as $200 Million. His real estate holdings are said to exceed $50 Million, and he has owned a car collection that includes Jaguars, Ferraris, Rolls Royces, and Bentleys.</p><p>He has also acquired what is said to be the largest photographic collection on earth.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=sir-elton-john-real-estate-holdings><strong>Sir Elton John Real Estate Holdings</strong></h2><p>Despite his early success, Elton John lived with his parents in a small flat up to 1974. Then, he acquired his 1750s estate, Woodside, located in Berkshire, England.</p><p>This property was purchased for £400&nbsp;000 and was completely refurbished in the late 1980s.</p><p>He also has property across the world in Europe and North America. His Beverley Hills estate was acquired for $33 Million in 2015. It is a mammoth 25,000 square feet of living space with a huge multi-car garage, wine cellar, gym, and screening room.</p><p>He also owns a duplex penthouse in Atlanta and properties in Venice and Nice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=sir-elton-hercules-john><strong>Sir Elton Hercules John</strong></h2><p>Elton John became Sir Elton John in 1998 when he received his knighthood at Buckingham Palace. He is married to David Furnish and has two sons, Elijah Joseph Daniel Furnish-John and Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John.</p><p>He is now known as Sir Elton Hercules John after changing his name by deed poll. As one of the world’s most iconic musicians, Sir Elton John has amassed a considerable fortune by helping various charities and has been recognized for his work and donations to many worthy causes.</p><p>From his humble beginnings in London, Elton John’s net worth has increased to the point where his&nbsp;considerable fortune is on par with the adoration of the world’s most beloved musician.</p><h2>Elton John FAQs</h2><h3 itemprop=name>What is Elton John Net Worth?</h3><p itemprop=text>Elton John net worth is currently $550 million USD.</p><h3 itemprop=name>How much money does Elton John earn?</h3><p itemprop=text>Elton John earns $48 million per year from various sources.</p><h3 itemprop=name>How tall is Elton John?</h3><p itemprop=text>Elton John is 5 ft 7 in (1.7 m)</p><h3 itemprop=name>How old is Elton John?</h3><p itemprop=text>Elton John is currently 76 years old.</p><h3 itemprop=name>When is Elton John birthday?</h3><p itemprop=text>Elton John birthday is on 25th March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvLsKatZpOkunCxy62mp2WapLWvec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ed-oxenbould-net-worth-141182.html><span>←</span><span>Ed Oxenbould Net Worth</span></a>
