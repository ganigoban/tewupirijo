Harry Leong, a Victoria businessman, who arrived in Canada in 1950, has left us at the age of 94. He was a pillar of the community, and his legacy will forever be cherished.</p><p>Harry’s dedication to his craft was evident in his long-standing ownership of Harry’s Flowers on Oak Bay Avenue, where he served the community with passion and devotion. For many years, he shared his love for flowers with the people of Victoria.</p><p>On September 7, 2023, Harry peacefully passed away, surrounded by all three generations of his loving family. He is survived by his sister Bernice (Steven) Chan, his daughter May Lin, his sons Merlin (Amy) and John, his four grandchildren Ingrid (Michael), Derrek, Mark (Jill), and Rachel, as well as his great-granddaughter Margot May. The Leong family is deeply grateful for the care provided by May Lin to her father over the course of many years.</p><p>Born in Zhongshan, China, Harry ventured to Canada in 1950, seeking new opportunities and a brighter future. Alongside his beloved wife, Sau Lan, he shared 46 years of marriage until her unfortunate passing in 1993. Together, they owned and operated Harry’s Flowers, which holds the distinction of being Victoria’s oldest flower shop. Their warmth and kindness touched the hearts of everyone they served, earning them the affection of the entire community.</p><p>Beyond his florist endeavors, Harry had a zest for life. He had a passion for singing, enjoyed culinary delights, excelled in the kitchen, and found solace in fishing. An occasional trip to the casino added a touch of excitement to his days. His good looks and charming smile were recognized in every eating establishment in Victoria, where he made countless friends.</p><p>A memorial service to celebrate Harry Leong’s life will be held at Sands Funeral Chapel, 1803 Quadra Street, on Saturday, September 16, 2023, at 10:00 am. In lieu of flowers, those who wish to honor Harry’s memory may make donations in his name to Victoria Hospice.</p><h5>read more:<a href=#>Pete Kozachik Cause of Death, Oscar-Nominated ‘Nightmare Before Christmas’ VFX Artist,</a></h5><p>Harry Leong’s memory will forever bloom in the hearts of those who knew him, and his legacy as a dedicated businessman and a beloved member of the community will continue to flourish like the flowers he so passionately tended to.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
