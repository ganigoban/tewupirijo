KIHEI — The Seabury Hall girls paddlers had one thing in mind on Saturday at Maui Interscholastic League regatta No. 5: join their mixed and boys classmates as champions.
The Spartans’ Keala Bouwens, Kahea Haupu, Annalise Lambert, Kekua Richards, Amber Proctor and Tatum Hoshino edged rival King Kekaulike by a little more than a second to claim the girls MIL title at Ka Lae Pohaku."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The Seabury Hall boys and mixed crews wrapped up their MIL titles last week with their third wins of the season.</p><p>Baldwin and Kamehameha Maui joined Seabury Hall as boys state qualifiers, while Baldwin and King Kekaulike were the mixed qualifiers behind the Spartans.</p><p>Seabury Hall coach Paul Luuwai was overjoyed to complete the sweep — the Spartans last accomplished the feat in 2017. The girls crew came up 3.45 seconds short of Na Alii last week.</p><p><span class=quotations>“What a race and we had so much errors to correct,”</span> Luuwai said. “The video tells a thousand words, so we’re, like, ‘Are you kidding?’ We totally fell on our heads last week and our top stroker was out — she had a throat infection. … She came back, Keala Bouwens has missed the last two (regattas) and she is a key in our boat.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The girls persevered, Kekaulike is a great team –five of those girls are my summer girls (for Hawaiian Canoe Club), so my hats off to them. I love them to death as well.”</span></p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX6PaGdrZ6OarqPB0bJkoKGiocBur8Cpq66qlWK6qriMqZidnJyeu6h506KrpZ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sally-j-smith-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sally J.
