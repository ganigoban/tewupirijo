It all went down in the UK just as she'd completed a run of concerts in Europe. But out of nowhere, the conversation veered into personal territory with&nbsp;Julie Adenuga asking her what she gained from the forced experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/91/72/427291_ae5ddb9cf16d4c72efbc55686b3ea80a.jpg><h6>Taylor Hill/Getty Images</h6><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I want ... Actually, you know what? I don't even want anything from Drake. Drake, he can have it all. He can have it all…Drake, if you're listening right now, can I please get a feature?" she asked, in a beggar's stance. "I am a struggling artist from Chicago I really need some money, Drake. Please help me. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Summer Walker</a> is cool, but rock with me. I've been out here since day one, 2010, getting it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for her the issue of her chastity, Noname directed her interviewers' curiosities towards the attention she gave the subject on her debut mixtape Telefone. "[Telefone]&nbsp;has made the whole world think I'm like, I'm this bubbly queen. I'm like, no.&nbsp;You need to know that I was sexually deprived for a really long part of my life. Really that's where my fans, that's where they come in. It's just sympathy," she answered Adenuga.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As I mentioned earlier, Noname also touches on the breast reduction surgery she underwent at a younger age, a procedure she reflects upon during the course of "Don't Forget About Me" off her&nbsp;last project Room 25.
