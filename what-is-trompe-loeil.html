I remember my professeur (that's professor in French) saying the term meant "trick of the eye," but it wasn't until she showed us photos of buildings and ornate wall drawings that I really was able to understand what it meant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let's start by how you say the phrase before we explain what it means in the fashion world: Trump (sorry) + Loy (as in "oy" with an "l" in front of it). Easy enough, right? Now that we got that down ...</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On a building, trompe l'oeil is expressed when something is painted on a wall that typically is three dimensional, say, a window, but instead, is just, well, paint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>RELATED</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>: WTF is...a Dirndl?</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's a visual illusion meant to create the experience that a three-dimensional object—be it a window, a cloud, a flower—is actually there. In reality, though, you're just looking at concrete. The phrase translates from French to English to literally mean "deceives the eye."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So how does this work when it comes to fashion? Look no further than brands like Moschino and Gucci for examples. But brands consistently use trompe l'oiel throughout their collections in whimsical ways. My personal favorite example: a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>$13,500 Gucci gown</a> from the Cruise 2018 collection. Thanks to the trompe l'oeil pleating, the gown is made to seem mythical, almost Grecian. In reality, it's a simple frock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Listen to 26 Celebrities Try to Pronounce Cannes</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A T-shirt with a beautiful bow silkscreened on versus an actual bow applique, a pair of jeans with lines painted on to create the appearance of fading or creasing, a sweater with a pearl necklace painted on ... all examples of trompe l'oeil in fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And now you know.
