Back in 2014, the actress, 44, adopted her daughter Isabella, who was eleven at the time. "I love her so much and she's such a good person. And I love that she's very girly," Rosario gushed to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a> this month.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Ahsoka – trailer</figure><p id=ea-UylUC5cG data-wc=31>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Women's Health</a> about the day she brought Isabella home with her, Rosario said that the pre-teen was already "a very whole person," explaining, "We're building up trust even still."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZisMvBxn6y data-wc=51>During the 2020 interview, Rosario opened up about the benefits of seeing a family therapist over the years, which has strengthened her bond with Isabella. The Ahsoka star revealed that she also decided to keep Isabella away from social media initially, and she even waited to get her a cell phone.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84406cb62d37-rosario-dawson-cuddling-daughter-isabella.jpg><p id=eCFm89_tWXU data-wc=46>"I think it would have been difficult to bond so late in her life, and in our lives together, if we'd had technology between us," Rosario told the publication. "My daughter looks me in the eye, and we talk to each other. I think that's important."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eMHXJYyfB8r data-wc=30>Asked about Isabella's birth mom in August 2023, Rosario told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a>: "We've had a chance to talk to her a couple times early on, but she kind of disappeared again.&nbsp;</p><p id=eT6HR3oo_Md data-wc=39>"We absolutely would love to be able to have that, especially because Isabella has siblings," added Rosario. "That's part of our conversation regularly of, like, just being prepared. She feels like an only child, but technically, she's really not."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/495e5a235e5d-rosario-dawson-daughter-isabella-with-her-dad-greg.jpg><p id=eO8zELqYV7l data-wc=29>Speaking to Health&nbsp;magazine, Rosario reflected that adoption, while different from pregnancy, has been incredibly rewarding. "I'm grateful for her development, our maturation, and our connection," the star said.&nbsp;</p><p id=evKO6eUezmx data-wc=41>"To have a young person move in with you and to have to really consciously work through triggers and that kind of stuff is a really different thing than being pregnant and having your baby grow up in front of you."</p><p id=esvjrnMCYq data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Paris Fury's moving confession following dramatic birth of baby daughter</a></p><p id=enYrpvctZj9 data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Rihanna's major baby name clue for second child everyone is talking about</a></p><p id=eEud0Yfnwuq data-wc=39>Isabella, who is now 20, prefers to live her life away from the spotlight, but she has attended a few red-carpet events alongside her mom. Earlier this month, Rosaria detailed Isabella's newfound passion for activism while chatting to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>ET</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df1d9e29d5cc-rosario-dawson-daughter-dad-greg.jpg><p id=eVwhe-McKeh data-wc=54>"I remember me and my daughter were talking and she was like, 'You know, I'm just not interested in being on a podium like you, mom. I'm not going to do that kind of thing,' and I was like, 'Well, that doesn't mean that you can't be an advocate, or an activist, or volunteer.'"</p><p id=eNEyPxwMgX9 data-wc=41>Rosario continued: "She started drawing all of these really amazing posters around conservation and anti-violence and it was just powerful. We need artists to make signs and write beautiful things that make people understand what we're trying to deal with here."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx2fI9yZ29noqTAor7IqGSdmaeovK95wqWmrJ1dl7yvsIydmK6fmKmys3nIrJibnZyhrm6wwLCqqKZdp7K3scClnJ1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./actor-sean-penn-marries-girlfriend-leila-george.html><span>←</span><span>Actor Sean Penn marries girlfriend Leila George</span></a>
