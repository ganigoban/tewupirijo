He signed her to a long-term contract at Paramount and renamed her Veronica Lake, supposedly wanting a first name that suggested a classic beauty, according to <a href=#>Turner Classic Movies</a>, and a last name inspired by her very blue eyes. During filming, Lake's hair accidentally fell over one eye in the middle of a take, giving rise to her trademark and a resulting national trend. As reported by <a href=#>The Vintage News</a>, Lake was eventually asked by the United States government to change her look when women took up factory work during <a href=#>World War II</a> and risked workplace accidents because of hairstyles that dipped over one eye and impeded workers' vision. The result were victory rolls; Lake even filmed a tutorial to demonstrate how to create the safer hairstyle that swept hair away from the face and kept it back.&nbsp;</p><p>"I Wanted Wings" made Lake a star, and the 19-year-old quickly made five films in a row, including the Preston Sturges classic "Sullivan's Travels," in which she played a character known just as "The Girl"&nbsp;who serves to enchant and inspire a film director who's taken time off to live life as a houseless traveler in order to experience "real life."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEl21ubWhfrLWiwIywmKxlpJ2ybrjArKtmnpmhum7CxKump6GTlnqtrcqeZJqooJqus7HDZqCnZZKas7C%2BxGaqoZ1dmbamsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-jaeger-has-the-most-kills.html><span>←</span><span>What Jaeger has the most kills?</span></a>
