He earned Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in “Training Day” (2001) and “Boyhood” (2014), as well as Best Adapted Screenplay nominations for co-writing “Before Sunset” (2004) and “Before Midnight” (2013).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Ethan Hawke’s Parents?</h2><p>Ethan Hawke’s parents, Leslie (formerly Green), a devoted charity worker, and James Hawke, an insurance actuary, began their journey as high school sweethearts in Fort Worth, Texas. Choosing to embark on the path of marriage at a young age, they tied the knot when Leslie was just 17 years old. Ethan Hawke entered the world a year later, becoming a part of their lives.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>At the time of Hawke’s birth, both of his parents were students at the University of Texas at Austin, illustrating their commitment to education even as they navigated the responsibilities of parenthood. Unfortunately, the union did not endure, and the couple separated, ultimately finalizing their divorce in 1974, when Ethan was merely four years old. Following the separation, Ethan Hawke was primarily raised by his mother, Leslie.</p><p>Their life took them on various journeys as they relocated several times before finding stability in New York City. It was in the bustling city that Hawke attended the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, shaping his early education. Around the age of 10, significant changes unfolded in Ethan Hawke’s family life. His mother remarried, leading to a relocation to West Windsor Township, New Jersey. This transition marked a new chapter in Hawke’s upbringing, presenting him with fresh surroundings and experiences as he continued to grow and evolve within the embrace of his restructured family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Beyond acting, <a href=# rel=noopener>Hawke</a> ventured into directing, with films like “Chelsea Walls” (2001), “The Hottest State” (2006), and “Blaze” (2018), along with the documentary “Seymour: An Introduction” (2014). He also created, co-wrote, and starred as John Brown in the Showtime limited series “The Good Lord Bird” (2018) and directed the HBO Max documentary series “The Last Movie Stars” (2022). Additionally, he played Arthur Harrow in the Marvel television miniseries “Moon Knight” (2022).</p><p>Hawke’s theatrical involvement is noteworthy, including a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play for Tom Stoppard’s “The Coast of Utopia” in 2007. He made his Broadway debut in 1992 in Anton Chekhov’s “The Seagull” and directed Sam Shepard’s “A Lie of the Mind” in 2010, receiving a Drama Desk Award nomination.</p><p>A feminist, Hawke has criticized the male-dominated nature of the movie business. He supports individual rights, and he has expressed support for Colin Kaepernick. Hawke is also active in philanthropy, co-chairing the New York Public Library’s Young Lions Committee and co-founding the Young Lions Fiction Award. Politically, he aligns with the Democratic Party, supporting candidates like Bill Bradley, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.
