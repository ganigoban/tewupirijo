The "Girls Need Love" singer and producer London On Da Track welcomed a baby girl back in March. Summer Walker's opinionated personality immediately translated over to her approach to motherhood, as she would not show her daughter’s face on social media for safety and privacy reasons. Fans both supported and critiqued her for the decision to keep that part of her life private. Her first share of her baby girl, posted on May 15, garnered even&nbsp;more criticism, as some were saying the child’s legs gave the appearance of a malnourished baby, but many fans simultaneously came to her defense.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Dark Life Of Joran Van Der Sloot</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>

Actress Jurnee Smollett has remained protective of her image and what projects she gets involved in.
"I'm very aware of the over-sexualization of the Black female body — this perverted fascination that predates me — and so the notion that I would ever contribute to that weighs very heavily on me," said Smollett to The Hollywood Reporter on why she refuses to do nudity.
