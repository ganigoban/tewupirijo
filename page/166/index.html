[Music & Lyrics by Kerry King][Verse 1]
Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckin' day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
No lookin back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see [Chorus]
