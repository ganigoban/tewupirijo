John Krasinski and Emily Blunt might've won the award for cutest couple at the Golden Globes tonight. The duo, who tied the knot in 2010, did more than flaunt their love on the red carpet; they were also adorable during the awards show. While Blunt, star of Mary Poppins Returns, presented an award with costar Dick Van Dyke, her hubby proudly looked on from the audience. He even cheered her on from his seat, and instantly melted hearts across America.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Julianne Moore reflects on challenges with family as she celebrates 63rd birthday alongside her son</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

Julianne Moore is back on the silver screen this week with the highly-anticipated release of May December on Netflix, an eerie drama based on Mary Kay Letourneau, starring Natalie Portman and Charles Melton.
Plus, the Hunger Games actress has reason to celebrate in her personal life as much as she does in her professional life, with her 63rd birthday falling on December 3rd.
Now, as her schedule continues to ramp up with red carpets and TV appearances for May December – especially with the SAG-AFTRA strike in the rearview mirror – the A-Lister reflected on her "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kara Wolters Drinan Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

If it was acceptable to get ready for formal events without actually going, I’d RSVP to every wedding, party, and fancy dinner I possibly could. Dressing up gives me so much confidence, but the inevitable discomfort of makeup, dresses, and most notoriously, heels, always ruins all the fun. For people whose job often involves an elevated dress code (like the British Royal family, for example), popping on stilettos is basically putting on a uniform.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Keith McCants Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

<a href=../../776373-kodak-black-donald-trump-endorsement-music-news.html></a>
Kodak Black has vocally endorsed Donald Trump. However, the rapper went well beyond simply stating his voting preference. "We should have Donald Trump in office for 20 years," Black declared. Of course, this is not the first time that Black has linked up with the former President. Trump gave Black a presidential pardon, though that action did little to curtail Black's run-ins with the legal system.

Kyle Kuzma has been one of the few bright spots on the Los Angeles Lakers this season and has been taking full advantage of the Los Angeles lifestyle. As a 23-year-old man, it's probably a great time to be in L.A. right now. Although, what hasn't been so great for Kuzma is his attempts at winning the affection of Farrah Abraham who of course rose to prominence thanks to her time on the show&nbsp;Teen Mom.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>La Donaira Hotel Review, Montecorto, Andaluca</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

Pink Tape is finally here, and odds are that you like at least one of Lil Uzi Vert's 26 tracks on it (although fan consensus indicates that people are mostly enjoying a big chunk of the tracklist). Still, even if you aren't the biggest fan of the project, you can't deny that songs like "Endless Fashion," featuring Nicki Minaj, are clear highlights. On the bouncy and bright cut, the two MCs trade ridiculous bars, clever wordplay, and of course, plenty of flexes of their luxury fashion sense.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/91/>← Prev Page</a>
