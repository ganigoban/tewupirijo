Distracting us from the sexy on-screen moment, however, were their outfits. Lively, for her part, combined three different camo prints into a single outfit, which consisted of button-up shirt layered underneath an oversized jacket and paired with cargo pants that were stuffed into her beige suede boots. She carried a brown handbag and accessorized with gold jewelry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Baldoni's look arguably raised even more eyebrows, as he wore a bright teal onesie emblazoned with rainbows and unicorns with a black T-shirt, a fluffy pink tail, and Nike sneakers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in June, Hoover addressed the controversy surrounding the cast's wardrobe during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Today</a>. "I don't remember describing outfits at all. I don't care what they have on," she said. "In my head, it's about the conversation they're having and the story. It's the same way in the movie." The author added, "You've seen a couple of outfits that are completely out of context. I'm not worried about it."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It Ends with Us will debut in theaters on June 21, 2024.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waWYpJ1doba3scuyZJygkaTBqq%2BMqKytnpmpeqy10qygp59dn8K0wMinZJuZnJm8r7WMoqtmnZ6ZwG7DyK2fZq2jYoV1fpVqbmw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-belgian-liege-waffles.html><span>←</span><span>Best Belgian Liege Waffles Modern Honey</span></a>
