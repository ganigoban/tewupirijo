Today, the actor slash director and TV producer turns 45. And, although he is certainly best known for his role playing advertising executive Don Draper on Mad Men, he's also made a name for himself as a Hollywood hunk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since beginning his career back in 1996 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>as a contestant</a> on the reality dating show The Big Date, Hamm's risen to the top, landing major roles in both TV and film. At the start of his career, Hamm made appearances in several television series, including CSI Miami, Gilmore Girls, Ally McBeal, and Related. Since then, his career's taken off and his fan-favorite TV roles include those in Mad Men, 30 Rock, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. As for film, we can't forget about how funny he was opposite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kristen Wiig</a> in Bridesmaids, not to mention his voiceover performance as Herb Overkill (husband to super villain Scarlet Overkill) in the 2015 Minions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Hamm is as good-looking as ever. Constantly out and about in the public eye, Hamm's busy schedule never stops—which means he's got plenty of projects to promote and red carpets to walk. As a result, he frequently steps out wearing top-notch designer suits and tuxedos that leave him looking oh-so-dapper. To see for yourself, these are the Mad Men star's best red carpet looks, in honor of his birthday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeapLtutMCmpGaZl5p6o7XRrZ%2Bdmalir6a%2F02apnpxdmK6zvMStZKWnn6DA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-lithgow-net-worth-210661.html><span>←</span><span>John Lithgow Net Worth</span></a>
