Despite the vulnerable, complex characters she has become known for, Scarlett's rise was marked by a confidence beyond her years.</p><p id=e6ec6kIUcLfn data-wc=34>As a child growing up in New York, she regularly auditioned for advertising work. But the youngster's distinctive features and husky voice didn't sit well with ad execs in search of the all-American kid.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Acting Career</h2><p id=e1Qq4Kjv0b data-wc=60>Despite numerous rebuttals, however, the youngster was determined not to give up; she planned on following in the footsteps of another child star, Jodie Foster all the way to the top. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute For Young People and within just a few months won a speaking part opposite <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Ethan Hawke</a> in the Broadway play &nbsp;</p><p id=e2LqvGqrSCz data-wc=48>But it was in the 1998 romance , as Kristin Scott Thomas' troubled daughter, that she caught Tinseltown's attention. The movie's leading man <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Robert Redford</a> described her as "13 going on 30" and top casting agents immediately realised there was a hot new talent in town.</p><p id=ecb9bQDLAZs data-wc=38>Scarlett grew up in New York, the joint youngest of four children she has a twin brother, Hunter. Her father, an architect, immigrated from Denmark at the age of 27, leaving behind his first wife and Scarlett's half-brother.&nbsp;</p><p id=etaGY1dzJo data-wc=30>In the Big Apple Karsten Johansson married again and established a living in New York's building trade. Those close to Scarlett talked of her having a wisdom beyond her years.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWlZ0ILWG2 data-wc=37>"She makes you feel like she has been around the world," said director Sofia Coppola. "She has a coolness and a subtlety that you would not expect. You feel like she's seen a lot."&nbsp;</p><p id=ekkuXYWMpot data-wc=40>Despite being very much a New Yorker, Scarlett took to the Hollywood scene with aplomb. The A-list status had its benefits, such as an art collection, a cool BMW and even cooler boyfriends. She's dated Josh Hartnett and Sean Penn.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Personal Life</h2><p id=eQAybGhnRD data-wc=35>From 2008 to 2010, Scarlett was married to Ryan Reynolds. Her next serious relationship was with French creative agency boss Romain Dauriac. The couple announced their engagement in 2013 and Scarlett became pregnant soon after.</p><p id=ehso7mHZVa data-wc=20>Meanwhile, in 2020, the actress tied the knot with American comedian Colin Jost. Together they share a son called Cosmo.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUZztw36_W data-wc=50>Having proved herself as an actress she began to set sights on future challenges, which include testing her mettle behind the camera. Most first-time directors start off with a short. Scarlett, on the other hand, is more inclined to think big. "I'd rather just dive into a feature," she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQrtG-IUDY data-wc=42>"I don't know if I'd necessarily be good at making a short film. I definitely want to make a big epic film, not necessarily , but a larger than life subject I want to make all kinds of movies, I'm totally ambitious."</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9va2BkwKSt0aWcraxdn7yprc2sqqimXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ron-klain-parents-meet-ron-klairs-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Ron Klain Parents: Meet Ron Klairs Parents</span></a>
