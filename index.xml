Back to 1995 when we were nothing
Walking through the streets of Boston no one listening
No one caring about the empty rooms we played
Until they all showed up one for one day
Then we turned our stage and everything changedTurn that shit out louder! Make it all go faster! Playing through the witching hour! Take it to one thousand horsepower! Under lights now
Playing to the masses everything feels right</description></item><item><title> Merle Haggard Me and Crippled Sol</title><link>/me-and-crippled-soldiers-html.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/me-and-crippled-soldiers-html.html</guid><description>Now that it's alright to burn the stars and stripes

And be proud to hear old glories on the ground
