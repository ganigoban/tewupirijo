Of course, this proved a serious issue for the Hebrew slaves living in the Babylonian kingdom. After all, the Ten Commandments expressly forbid them from indulging in idolatry: "I am the Lord thy God: thou shalt not have strange Gods before me" (via the <a href=#>British Library</a>).</p><p>Despite the direct prohibition against worshipping idols, all complied except for three young men: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. <a href=#>What Christians Want to Know</a> reports, "Nebuchadnezzar was essentially the representation of everything that embodies human sinfulness driven by the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride." And like all good megalomaniacs, he couldn't let a little rebellion go to waste. So, he ordered the young Israelites burned alive in a fiery furnace. Fortunately, this backfired on the king due to divine intervention. The men survived the flames unscathed, along with an angelic fourth companion, restoring the Israelites' faith in the Lord.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkGtpamxfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2gtq%2BzjKecm62Tna6lusSzsZqqXaSzbq7Am7Clp55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-untold-truth-of-bradley-coopers-ex-jennifer-esposito.html><span>←</span><span>The Untold Truth Of Bradley Cooper's Ex Jennifer Esposito</span></a>
