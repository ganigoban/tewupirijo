In it, he reflects on much of his personal evolution and his career trajectory, with one particular moment being a key point of support and reminiscing. Moreover, the Haitian-Canadian producer came out as gay in a 2016 piece with The FADER, and took this RS opportunity to reflect on that development. Specifically, he spoke on how <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Freddie Gibbs</a> was one of the first artists to champion his experience and perspective, which gave him hope moving forward in an industry that used to treat the LGBTQIA2+ community much more harshly, and that sometimes still falls victim to that bigotry.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I still don’t think many people know that I’m gay</a>. Even with that story," KAYTRANADA remarked to Rolling Stone. "Freddie Gibbs was one of the first artists that was like, ‘I’m proud of you, man, keep doing your thing.’ I thought that was crazy. That gave me hope. Now, we got&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Nas X</a>&nbsp;and rappers from the LGBT community just coming out. R&B artists, too. It’s more acceptable and more welcome. I heard&nbsp;Snoop [Dogg]&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dr. Dre</a>&nbsp;were performing at Pride in L.A. That’s crazy." Freddie even quote-tweeted coverage of this thankfulness with another sweet message: "That’s my homie in real life tho [fingers crossed emoji]."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-freddie-gibbs-responds-to-kaytranada-s-thankfulness>Freddie Gibbs Responds To KAYTRANADA's Thankfulness</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for their link-ups, KAYTRANADA and Freddie Gibbs have a couple of tracks together, namely "My Dope House," "Alexys," and the KAYTRAMINÉ cut "letstalkaboutit." Hopefully the Big Boss Rabbit and the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Lover/Friend</a>" sonic wizard reunite for some more collabs in the future. While Freddie won't appear on Timeless (as listed at press time), there are plenty of other amazing guests to look forward to. These include Channel Tres, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Childish Gambino</a>, PinkPantheress, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Don Toliver</a>, Charlotte Day Wilson, Thundercat, Anderson .Paak, Mariah The Scientist, Ravyn Lenae, and many more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, KAYTRANADA is fresh off releasing one of the surefire summer bops of 2024 with Mach-Hommy and 03 Greedo's "#RICHAXXHAITIAN," the titular track off <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Mach's newest masterpiece</a>. If Timeless lives up to that moniker, we're in for an absolute treat. Surely we'll get some more breezy jams and bops to blast all the way through blistering days under the sun. But most importantly, it's great to hear KAYTRA reflect on those who had his back every step of the way.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZYZ6f5dmopqxpKeur63DmmSsnaiqrq2107Jkoqakmr%2B3tcSwZJ%2BqlZmxqrGMoKCbmqNitaq8jKGmqWWemsS0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-hughes-net-worth-156870.html><span>←</span><span>John Hughes Net Worth</span></a>
