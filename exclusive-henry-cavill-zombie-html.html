He has a Mass Effect movie trilogy <a href=#>in the works</a>, he still has <a href=#>The Witcher</a> Season 2 headed our way, and there are even <a href=#>rumors</a> that he could be returning to the role of Superman on HBO Max. It certainly sounds like he has plenty on his plate, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other projects that he would love to throw his hat into. And Giant Freakin Robot has obtained some exclusive info about one such endeavor that he would love to be a part of. And it just so happens that it would reunite him with one of his favorite directors.</p><p>According to our trusted inside source – the same one that has provided Giant Freakin Robot with multiple confirmed exclusive scoops that have included the reveal that Bruce Wayne’s parents will be&nbsp;<a href=#>evil</a>&nbsp;in Robert Pattinson’s&nbsp;The Batman, Bruce Campbell will&nbsp;<a href=#>appear</a>&nbsp;for a cameo in&nbsp;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and that Monica Rambeau will be one of the&nbsp;<a href=#>main characters</a>&nbsp;in the upcoming Disney+ series&nbsp;Secret Invasion&nbsp;– Henry Cavill really wants to work with Zack Snyder again on his Army of the Dead franchise. The Netflix film looks to be a major production for Netflix and there are already other projects that will be expanding the world of Army of the Dead. There is a <a href=#>prequel</a> film as well as an <a href=#>anime series</a> that will both be making their way to Netflix this year along with the main feature film. It certainly sounds like the streaming giant wants to be in the Army of the Dead business in a big way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/henry-cavill-2-900x506.jpg><p>And getting Henry Cavill attached to another film in the franchise would certainly make headlines. Even just getting it rumored that he might join your <a href=#>zombie project</a> would be good for anybody looking for funding. Obviously, the actor has a good relationship with Netflix thanks to his work on The Witcher. It is possible he could parlay that into being able to work with Zack Snyder once again. What really has us curious is what kind of zombie project Cavill would be a part of. With the prequel film and the anime series already shot or far along in production, does this mean that Netflix is already making plans for Army of the Dead 2? It would seem like a waste of Henry Cavill if they didn’t have him be a featured player in a live-action movie. And making him a starring character in the sequel would certainly raise that movie’s profile. Plus, fans would love to see Henry Cavill and <a href=#>Dave Bautista</a> sharing the screen together.</p><p>It would be awesome to see Henry Cavill and Zack Snyder work together outside of the <a href=#>DC Extended Universe</a> and especially on an action-horror franchise like Army of the Dead. Getting to see Cavill flex a different part of his acting talents under the direction of Zack Snyder would be a genuine curiosity. It would be doubly intriguing if Cavill was cast in an antagonistic role in an Army of the Dead sequel. Seeing Superman become a bad guy in the zombie apocalypse sounds somewhat entertaining. We are crossing our fingers that this reunion will be able to take place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2idqJi5tr%2FIr5xmoJWjv7p5wpqtoqScYsewucGinGegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erins-adobo-eggplant-quesadillas.html><span>←</span><span>Erins Adobo Eggplant Quesadillas</span></a>
