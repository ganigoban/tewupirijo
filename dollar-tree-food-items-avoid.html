Virgin olive oil</h2><p>Sarah said to stop buying Dollar Tree's Pampa brand product that says it's a blend of soybean and olive oil if you do.</p><p>"It's made to look like it's extra virgin olive oil but it's really 95 percent soybean oil and it contains GMOs," Sarah said.</p><p>She said she prefers to buy a smaller extra virgin olive oil Dollar Tree sells by Gourmet Empire, which she showed in the video.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>"It's pure extra virgin olive oil and it's a much better option for you."</p><p>The Pampa blend of soybean and olive oil 8.5-ounce bottles are priced at $1.25 each on the store's website.</p><p>The Gourmet Empire extra virgin olive oil in her video that she said she prefers is not listed on Dollar Tree's website.</p><h2>2.

You can light it on fire and it will burn," Sarah replied to the comment.</p><p>Another asked: "So a block of cheese is better than shredded?" and Sarah said "Yes. It contains less fillers."</p><p>Sarah said she does love Dollar Tree's Pede Brothers brand frozen cheese ravioli, though.</p><p>"They make an easy dinner idea and they taste delicious."</p><p>The ravioli is not listed on Dollar Tree's website, either.</p><p>"I didn't care for the cheese ravioli. It was missing something," a person commented.</p><p>Sarah replied: "I’ve always liked them with a good sauce.</p><p>"We’ve made a lazy lasagna and it was fire but I get everyone’s tastes are different."</p><h2>3.

Skip this," she added.</p><p>She said she gets Dollar Tree's Utopia brand butter-flavored pancake syrup instead.</p><p>Sarahsaid: "This is great because it doesn't contain any high fructose corn syrup."</p><p>A 24-once bottle of the Utopia butter flavored pancake syrup is listed on Dollar Tree's website for $1.25 each.</p><p>The Sun contacted Dollar Tree for comment.</p><h2>How to cut grocery costs</h2><p>There are a number of tips to follow to&nbsp;<a href=#>slash your grocery shop every single time</a>, including meal planning and&nbsp;<a href=#>using coupons</a>.</p><p>Combine the two and you'll find yourself saving even more money.</p><p>It's also important to shop around so you're getting the best deals.</p><p>If you're on a low income, you may also qualify for&nbsp;<a href=#>food stamps</a>&nbsp;- more recently known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</p><p><a href=#>SNAP</a>&nbsp;households are expected to spend about 30% of their own resources on food.</p><p>Depending on your income and household size, the maximum monthly benefit amount is $250 for a single-person household while a household of four can get up to $835.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Love shopping at Dollar Tree? <a href=#>Here</a> are five food items a chef recommends from Dollar Tree to make a meal for less than $8.</p><p>An Aldi superfan said <a href=#>buy these 12 items</a> this week starting at $3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/xx-food-items-never-buy-757545268.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa350gpRpb2icn6G5or6MramenV2bvLCwjKKrnqWjYq63u8idZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-started-singing-in-church-sinach-used-to-carry-me-when-i-was-little-patoranking.html><span>←</span><span>I Started Singing In Church, Sinach Used To Carry Me When I Was Little- Patoranking</span></a>
