A quick scroll on Declan's feed reveals no images of Lauren remain there either. The fact the couple have had to do this speaks volumes about the amount of vitriol she's received over her appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5c24146d9ea7-gettyimages-1148462689.jpg><p id=e0kL7mlBUz data-wc=11>My first thought was - really? Are people STILL doing this?</p><p id=e3Udi4q8qq data-wc=29>Lauren is a gorgeous young woman, who has birthed a child less than two years ago. She was relaxing on holiday, wearing a swimsuit. What is the actual problem?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ac4c08ba968-gettyimages-1443253335.jpg><p id=evIfkux6EN data-wc=43>I'll be honest, as a mother myself, I felt so sad reading some of the downright disgusting things people have written. Women are always picked apart for what they look like, it's nothing new, which is not only depressing but also totally unfair.</p><p id=e6UO-vAgPt data-wc=82>For some reason, because football players are often seen with supermodels and actresses known for looking perfect all the time, people find the image of a beautiful woman who isn't a size 6 with a <a class=hm-link href=#>Premier League footballer&nbsp;</a>shocking. The pair are childhood sweethearts, have been together for eight years and have a baby boy called Jude. They are in a meaningful relationship and love each other. In the vain, vacuous world we live in, their romance should be celebrated, not shamed.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="10 adorable photos of England football stars with their kids: Harry Kane, Jordan Pickford & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/6e346101f8f7-football-dads-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="10 adorable photos of England football stars with their kids: Harry Kane, Jordan Pickford & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>10 adorable photos of England football stars with their kids: Harry Kane, Jordan Pickford & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Harry Kane 'over the moon' as he announces he is expecting his fourth child" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ba3f65fae5ce-gettyimages-1327529948.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Harry Kane 'over the moon' as he announces he is expecting his fourth child" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Harry Kane 'over the moon' as he announces he is expecting his fourth child</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I just watched Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story - and these are my honest thoughts" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/806f4f6aa785-coleen-rooney-d.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I just watched Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story - and these are my honest thoughts" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I just watched Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story - and these are my honest thoughts</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eKSX-Xr0Yp data-wc=71>As a mother-of-two, I also know what it's like to feel societal pressure to look your best after you've had children. You feel like you need to get back into exercise quickly and get rid of baby weight fast and might be paranoid about looking frumpy and 'mumsy'. Putting on any swimwear after having kids is so daunting. Your body just isn't the same. We've all been there, not just Lauren.</p><p id=es3T3ts29u data-wc=61>I don't know about anyone else, but when I'm on holiday, I don't care what I look like. I'm there to relax, get a tan and drink a cocktail (or four). If someone took a snap of me when I wasn't looking, whether that's getting out of the sea or chilling on a sunbed, I would hate that. We all would!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0b1c90bcbebf-screenshot-2024-04-24-123315.jpg><p id=e3GbpiC1PaW data-wc=52>When I get my husband to take a picture of me in a nice dress, he takes of snaps. And I pick the best one, not the one where the angle is awful. Lauren didn't get that luxury as a photographer picked the shot. Trolls would do well to remember this.</p><p id=etvtT06NhbJ data-wc=29>In the case of Lauren, that is all forgotten. Because she is dating a footballer that makes her fair game, right? What example does this set for women everywhere?</p><p id=eHCwWNrde61D data-wc=30>We are ALL Lauren, and we should support her. I can't wait until she's back on social media, I'll definitely be cheering her on, and I hope you do too.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
