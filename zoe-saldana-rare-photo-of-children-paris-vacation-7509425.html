In the sweet family snap, which was shared on Zoe’s Instagram Story, the quartet was pictured posing on the steps of La Basilique de Sacré Coeur de Montmartre wearing their individual versions of tourist chic. While Saldaña opted for a burgundy midiskirt paired with a black racerback tank and black open-toed sandals, her sons donned casual athleisure looks and tennis shoes.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram/zoe saldana</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A day to explore …” the actress captioned a separate Instagram Story that showed her walking with two of her sons through the Parisian streets.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Saldaña may tend to be rather private when it comes to her family life, this isn’t the first time that she’s given her kids a shoutout. When chatting with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle back in December 2022</a>, the mother-of-three opened up about how she already knows her sons will grow into “really pretty nerds.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They are going to grow up to be really pretty nerds,” she said of the trio’s budding love of fantasy. “I know that every parent finds their children super-handsome. Maybe that's what's to blame. But I look at my kids and I'm like, 'My god, you guys are so fucking handsome.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress then pointed out how her sons are already starting to recognize her role in Guardians of the Galaxy, adding, “I see how [my youngest is] trying to place me in his mind like, 'OK, you're mama, but you're also Gamora.' They're going to watch these movies, and it's going to be a part of what they like and what excites them. And the fact that that gives me street cred with my kids, it's fun, it's great."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK572aicZquRobGiusBmqZqqlWK9qbvTqGSonl2Ytaq4w6ucp2Wglr%2Bqv4yvmJyZpJ68r3mWbmdybGJq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-my-hermit-crab-just-sitting-there.html><span>←</span><span>Why is my hermit crab just sitting there?</span></a>
