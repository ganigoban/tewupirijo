No matter how much you moisturize, it can seem like your makeup clings onto and emphasizes the dry patches on your complexion.

We tapped professional makeup artists Dominique Lerma, Billie Gene, and Cassandra Garcia to get their most coveted tips and tricks for how to apply makeup on dry skin.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dominique Lerma</a> is a professional makeup artist based in Los Angeles.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Billie Gene</a> is a celebrity makeup artist.

"If you're someone who suffers from those dry areas during the harsh winter months, your first call to order should be solidifying a skin care routine that sets you up for successful makeup application."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you aren't already, start incorporating serums, moisturizers, and face mists into your routine with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>glycerin</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I like to use serums and dry oils to the skin before moisturizers to help revitalize the skin and prepare it for makeup application, said Gene. "I also tend to spray the face with a refreshing mist before moisturizer to add moisture and soften the skin for better absorption."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-exfoliate></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Exfoliate</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On top of adding moisturizing skin care products into your routine, exfoliating is one of the best ways to eliminate flaking skin. It also helps improve product absorption, which might not be happening because flakes and dead surface skin cells are blocking penetration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People often think that they shouldn't exfoliate if their skin is dry, but on the contrary, choosing gentle exfoliators will aid in preparing your skin to follow up with your skin-care regimen and then applying your makeup," said Lerma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The key to exfoliating dry skin is to use a gentle chemical exfoliant instead of harsh physical exfoliants like scrubs. For starters, consider&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lactic acid</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-skip-the-foundation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Skip the Foundation</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Lerma, instead of layering up on a full-coverage foundation in hopes of covering any dry patches, go with a lighter formula like a tinted moisturizer,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>BB cream, or CC cream</a>. This can prevent makeup from clinging to dry flakes and/or creating a cakey finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those severely dry patches, try spot-correcting those areas with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>concealer</a>&nbsp;for more coverage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You can cover dry patches with a hydrating concealer after the skin is prepped with proper skin care," added Gene. "Be sure to spot-treat, and don't rub the concealer on."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This brings us to our next point.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pat-dont-rub></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pat, Don't Rub</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gene said the technique you use to apply makeup can either help or worsen dry patches.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When applying [product] on dry or peeling skin, be sure to apply it in one direction when using a brush or pressing technique with a makeup sponge," Gene continued. "You don't want to rub the brush around the face (in different directions) too much because that can cause friction to the skin, resulting in the skin peeling even more."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-be-strategic-when-using-powders></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Be Strategic When Using Powders</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite what you may think, you don't have to completely skip powder formulas if you have a dry skin type. Whether you have combination-to-dry skin or a matte finish, you can use a powder, but you have to be strategic about placement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Be sure to apply the powder only where you need the additional coverage or setting," advised Gene.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, make sure you choose a finely milled powder and one that isn't full-coverage, which Lerma noted can make the skin look drier.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder</a>&nbsp;($47) is a great option.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-avoid-glowing-formulas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Avoid "Glowing" Formulas</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Garcia, always look for hydrating makeup products, but be careful about formulas that say they promote a glow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Something to be aware of a glowy formula is make sure there isn't texture with glow particles," Garcia said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, make sure the promised glow isn't due to shimmer or glitter in formulas because that can add more texture to flaking or peeling skin. Instead, look for formulas that keep it simple and boost hydration to offer that natural-looking glow.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you want, choose to add glow or shimmer in other places with a highlighting powder or cream so that no texture is added," suggested Garcia.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-face-mist-is-key></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Face Mist Is Key</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest tip to making your makeup last and avoiding dry patches or flakes appearing throughout the day is to keep a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>face mist</a>&nbsp;handy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best tip to keep your makeup smooth throughout the day during the winter is using a refreshing mist to help set the makeup," said Gene. "A spray can be used continuously throughout the day without interrupting makeup and keeping your look smooth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2ign6x6tbuMmqeppKliuqK3xK6nZpyirnq0t8in</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dallas-dally-winston.html><span>←</span><span>Find an Actor to Play Dallas &amp;quot;Dally&amp;quot; Winston in The Outsiders 2020 on myCast</span></a>
