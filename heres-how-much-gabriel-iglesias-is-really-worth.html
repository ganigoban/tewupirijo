If you missed him on <a href=#>Modern Family</a> or Narcos, then you might have seen him on Mr.&nbsp;Iglesisas.&nbsp;And if you have kids, there's a good chance that you heard his voice as Jimmy in 2014's The Nut Job, as Pepe Rodriguez in The Book of Life (which came out that same year), or as Cuatro in 2017's Ferdinand.</p><p>Thanks to his many gigs — as well as the likely lucrative <a href=#>deal with Netflix</a>&nbsp;for Mr. Iglesias that he signed in April 2018 — in the 12 months between June 2017 and June 2018, Iglesias took in a whopping $21 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, which put him among the <a href=#>highest-paid comedians</a> in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Iglesias might not have to worry about money these days, but the star told <a href=#>Netflix Is A Joke</a> that he actually gave up financial security in order to pursue comedy. "Believe it or not, I had a really, really good day job that paid me a lot of money and benefits," he explained. "I used to sell cell phones. I was clearing at the time in 1996, about five grand a month and for a 20-year-old, even now, that's insane."</p><p>That might be true, but it's nothing close to the $40 million Iglesias has now, according to Celebrity Net Worth. We bet he doesn't regret giving up that cell phone job and taking a chance on comedy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2pkZn10e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZeWr7O1xKVkop%2BcmsCqrdJmoKxlopqurbjYZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halle-berry-remembers-sidney-poitier.html><span>←</span><span>Halle Berry Remembers Sidney Poitier as &amp;quot;Angel in the Balcony&amp;quot; During Oscars Ceremony</span></a>
