 Oct 3rd 2006 !⃝ This song has a special inspiration behind it. My name is chase, and I attend the university of alabama. Walking home one day I passed an older black man with cerebal palsy(sp?) in a motorized wheel chair and became good friends with him. His name is nathan, and a book is written about his amazing story. Suffice it all to say that he was physically and mentally abused growing up, until his uncle took him to a cherry tree as a child to learn how to read, write, and grow."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

My name is chase, and I attend the university of alabama. Walking home one day I passed an older black man with cerebal palsy(sp?) in a motorized wheel chair and became good friends with him. His name is nathan, and a book is written about his amazing story. Suffice it all to say that he was physically and mentally abused growing up, until his uncle took him to a cherry tree as a child to learn how to read, write, and grow. Condemned to a wheel chair all his life, despite all of his problems, he has spent all his life trying to help others, even to send me free tickets to dave's final show of his 2006 tour in charlottesville, va. The song "dreaming tree" is about the cherry tree in tuscaloosa, al and nathan's impact on dave matthews life as he played several shows in tuscaloosa during his earlier years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZp2Zppp6rq3TrZ%2Ber6Nir6K6w2iroZ1dmb%2BmrcyipaBlpKeypg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dave-courtney-obituary-and-cause-of-death-is-dave-courtney-dead-how-did-dave-courtney-died.html><span>←</span><span>Dave Courtney Obituary And Cause Of Death Is Dave Courtney Dead?
