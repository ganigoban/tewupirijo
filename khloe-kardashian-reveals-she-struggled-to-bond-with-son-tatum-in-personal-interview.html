"I wasn't carrying him, I didn't really feel anything," she admitted, highlighting how the detachment began even before Tatum was born.&nbsp;</p><p id=en69T1v1Fub data-wc=53>This feeling was exacerbated by a personal shock in early December. "And then the first week of December, I found out that my ex was actually having a baby with somebody else," she disclosed, a revelation that made her decision to keep the surrogacy private until it was certain all the more painful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d829845023d1-khloe-kardashian-kids.png><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Khloé Kardashian weighs in on sister Kim Kardashian's controversial Met Gala dress: 'I am not OK'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/edc92613020d-gettyimages-1244602119.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Khloé Kardashian weighs in on sister Kim Kardashian's controversial Met Gala dress: 'I am not OK'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Khloé Kardashian weighs in on sister Kim Kardashian's controversial Met Gala dress: 'I am not OK'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian's new homes cost 51x average LA house" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2b446deff7d1-kris-jenner-khloe-kardashian-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian's new homes cost 51x average LA house" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian's new homes cost 51x average LA house</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Will Khloé Kardashian share True's first baby picture on Mother’s Day?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b743693364b0-group-2-3.png></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Will Khloé Kardashian share True's first baby picture on Mother’s Day?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Will Khloé Kardashian share True's first baby picture on Mother’s Day?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eNZ0tc1RDfr data-wc=51>As the reality of her impending motherhood became public, Khloé faced the overwhelming scrutiny of the media and social networks. "It devastated me because that's when all the judgment and the knives were thrown at me," she recalled, detailing the emotional toll it took on her during such a vulnerable time.</p><p id=eHIXJBPt3fz data-wc=26>Amid these challenges, Khloé had planned a special 'Mommy and me' trip with True, hoping for some final moments of one-on-one time before welcoming her son.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Khloe’s son Tatum explores in the garden</figure><p id=ePyETLErinD data-wc=20>However, her plans were abruptly interrupted when Dr. Aliabadi informed her of the need to deliver Tatum sooner than expected.&nbsp;</p><p id=ed6_6_mS7UY data-wc=43>"The baby wasn't due for another week or two and this was my last weekend with my daughter True. I just needed the weekend," Khloé explained, sharing the panic and chaos that ensued as she struggled to maintain her composure and maternal duties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6ee24ac9e0b2-khloe-kardashian-and-son-tatum.jpg><p id=emQn0MOoL-Z data-wc=50>In a moment of overwhelming anxiety and insistence on spending the weekend with True, Khloé broke down, leading to an extraordinary offer from Dr. Aliabadi. "She goes, 'You know what? I'll deliver the baby. I'll take the baby and you let me know when you're ready to pick him up,'"&nbsp;</p><p id=eNqPUvnllVK data-wc=39>Khloé recounted, amazed at the compassion shown by her doctor during such a critical moment. This gesture allowed Khloé to accept the reality of the situation, with her sister Kim Kardashian's experiences with surrogacy providing additional comfort and perspective.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/af3f603daf7d-khloe-kardashian-son-tatum.jpg><p id=eU8ElMWlcaZ data-wc=29>Naming her son Tatum also proved to be a reflective process for Khloé. Known for her family's penchant for unique names, she wanted something distinctive yet not overly unconventional.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0BqhzgQ7e6 data-wc=47>"I like unique names, but not off-the-wall names," she explained, noting that it took her about eight months to legally name him. During this time, she affectionately referred to him as 'Papa,' a nickname that helped bridge the emotional distance until she could feel a deeper connection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35a62e8fda6f-true-thompson-tatum-thompson-khloe-869272777b844f1.jpg><p id=eS126kNtxIg8 data-wc=35>Reflecting on her journey now, Khloé feels a profound bond with Tatum. "I am obsessed with Tatum now, of course," she beams, expressing how her initial detachment has transformed into an intense love and attachment.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecq6HMdxTPBm data-wc=56>She is keen to share her story to support others going through surrogacy, emphasizing that each journey is unique and should not be compared. "Anyone going through surrogacy, don't compare yourself to somebody else's journey," she advised, acknowledging the incredible gift it is to have surrogacy as an option and expressing gratitude towards the surrogate mothers.</p><p id=emPzGzOUEltT data-wc=14>"It's such a beautiful thing. But give yourself grace. Give yourself patience," Khloé urged.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
