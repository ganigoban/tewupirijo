In the end, Jey Uso did the&nbsp;<a href=#>unthinkable and pinned Roman Reigns – which was Reigns’ first pinfall loss since 2019</a>.</p><p>This led to the trial of Roman Reigns for this week’s episode of Friday Night Smackdown. Roman Reigns teased making Jey Uso the head of the table last week, but that didn’t happen as he made it clear he will remain The Tribal Chief. Afterwards, Jey Uso&nbsp;<a href=#>challenged him to match at SummerSlam</a>.</p><p>Jimmy Uso was also brutally attacked by Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa while Jey Uso helplessly watched. Solo Sikoa took to Twitter and commented on hospitalizing Jimmy Uso, stating that he is no longer the little brother.</p><p>I’m not “lil” brother anymore…</p><p>We will have to wait and see how WWE will book Roman Reigns and Jey Uso’s feud in the coming weeks, as the company has major plans for both of them at the SummerSlam Premium Live Event.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your view on this Solo Sikoa story?
