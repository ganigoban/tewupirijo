You can even put a candle in them to start off the special day by blowing out a candle and singing “Happy Birthday.”</p><p>I have seen IHOP’s famous Cupcake Pancakes and wanted to make them at home from scratch so here’s a copycat version of their recipe. I also saw a birthday pancake kit at Williams-Sonoma but it was $45! I knew that I could create a similar version at home for a fraction of the price.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Birthday-Funfetti-Pancakes-10.jpg alt="Light, Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes with Sprinkles and topped with a Cream Cheese Glaze.

Don’t get the skillet too hot or the exterior of the pancakes will cook too fast and burn before the center is fully cooked. A medium-low heat works well but I suggest doing a test pancake to ensure the heat is the optimal cooking temperature.</li><li><strong>Add a pat of butter or spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray</strong>. If you use butter, it adds a golden crust to the outside of the pancakes and some extra flavor.</li><li><strong>Pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pancake batter into the pan</strong>. Have your rainbow sprinkles ready! Generously sprinkle the rainbow sprinkles all over one side of the pancake before flipping it. Watch for the bubbles to appear on the top of the pancake and flip to cook the other side.</li><li><strong>Make the cream cheese glaze</strong> by stirring together softened cream cheese, melted butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Check for consistency. Add a touch of milk if you desire a thinner consistency.</li><li><strong>Stack the pancakes with sprinkles and drizzle on the sweet cream cheese glaze</strong> all over the top. Sprinkle with more rainbow sprinkles.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Birthday-Funfetti-Pancakes-5.jpg alt="Light, Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes with Sprinkles and topped with a Cream Cheese Glaze.

If you want to make festive 4th of July pancakes, you can use red, white, and blue sprinkles. If you want to make Easter pancakes, you can use pink, yellow, and light green sprinkles. If you want to make Christmas pancakes, you can use red, green, and white sprinkles.&nbsp;</p><h3>MORE PANCAKE RECIPES:</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Happy-Birthday-Funfetti-Sprinkles-Pancakes-Recipe.jpg alt="Light, Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes with Sprinkles and topped with a Cream Cheese Glaze.
