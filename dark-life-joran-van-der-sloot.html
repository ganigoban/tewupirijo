Flores, he said, hit him, and he first hit her back in response, then strangled her. "There was blood everywhere," the transcript read (via <a href=#>ABC News</a>). "What am I going to do now?"</p><p dir=ltr>His mother, Anita van der Sloot, spoke to the Dutch-language newspaper De Telegraaf amid the accusations and his confession, saying (via <a href=#>NBC News</a>) that while she still believed that he hadn't had anything to do with Holloway's disappearance, "Stephany, he may have killed. ... Joran is sick in his head, but he wanted no help," she added. She also said that she had no intention of visiting him while he was in jail and awaiting trial, lamenting, "If only he had listened to his mother. Then, this never would have happened."</p><p>Anita added that he blamed himself for his father's fatal heart attack, also suffered in 2010, and also said (via <a href=#>ABC News</a>): "I can cut certain things off, I can push them away. It's hard, but I'm trying to do that. ... I don't think that words are enough to tell the parents of Natalee Holloway and of Stephany Flores what I feel. ... If they would be here right now, I would cry with them and give them a big hug."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kXFvb3BnZLGivspmo6KelWK3sL7Ap2SvmZ5isaa%2BjKyjqKekZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./363549-summer-walker-receives-slander-over-her-baby-food-and-photos-news.html><span>←</span><span>Summer Walker Receives Slander Over Her Baby Food &amp;amp; Photos</span></a>
