(The Yorgos Lanthimos–directed film itself won the prize for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy.) The La La Land Oscar winner had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26048285/who-is-dave-mccary-emma-stone-boyfriend/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="husband Dave McCary" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">husband Dave McCary</a> by her side and her Poor Things castmates supporting her—along with two famous longtime friends in the audience: Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pop star’s and the actor’s reactions were caught on camera after Stone’s win, and spoke volumes about the women’s relationships. Lawrence was nominated in the same category, for her lead performance in raunchy comedy No Hard Feelings, and had jokingly mouthed, when her name was called during the listing of the nominees, “If I don’t win, I’m leaving.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She didn’t mean it. When Stone was revealed as the winner, J-Law stood up and cheered as if the victory were her own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Swift, meanwhile, also stood up to enthusiastically cheer for Stone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Stone and Swift have been friends since they were teenagers. Earlier this month on The Graham Norton Show, the actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/emma-stone-taylor-swift-friendship-eras-tour-falls-in-love-speak-now-1235574475/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="talked about" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">talked about</a> how she and Swift met “at the Young Hollywood Awards when [Swift] was 18 in L.A. We just kept in touch ever since and became great friends.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And Lawrence interviewed Stone for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/a22718593/emma-stone-jennifer-lawrence-turning-30-maniac-family/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Elle class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Elle</a> in 2018. That conversation also offered a revealing look at their friendship. “I notice that you bring up friendship a lot,” said Lawrence, who won her Oscar for 2012’s Silver Linings Playbook. “Is that important to you?”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“No,” Stone joked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Who’s your favorite friend?” Lawrence asked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I really like [your dog] Pippi,” Stone replied.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She has a personality!” Lawrence said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I love Pippi’s mom,” Stone added, meaning Lawrence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“So are friends important to you? And why?” J-Law followed up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think friendship is pretty much everything,” Stone answered more seriously. “Here’s another turning-30 thing I’ve realized: You pick your family. You realize that your friendships, the people who go with you into these next phases of your life—you’re choosing your family.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked which quality is most important in friendship, Stone said that “loyalty is enormous.” “You’ve been one of my most loyal friends for years,” she told Lawrence. “And I think [another important quality is] knowing that you can laugh together and that not everything has to be such a big deal.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg alt="Headshot of Alyssa Bailey" title="Headshot of Alyssa Bailey" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Alyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).
