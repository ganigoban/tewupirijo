He even helped Will Smith fight off alien invaders in Independence Day – twice! Now we’ll get to hear the melodic tones of his voice as he joins a new Dungeons & Dragons project.</p><p>Apart from his performance as the Grandmaster in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he manipulates primordial powers, we’ve never seen Goldblum in a role of a wizard. Well, that’s about to change, <a href=#>according to IGN</a>, as the actor embarks on an entirely new adventure voicing the elven sorcerer Balmur in the second season ofthe Dark Dice podcast. Balmur will make his debut on the podcast’s upcoming season as one of five player characters in the improvised audio drama, in which the elven sorcerer searches for his daughter’s missing locket. The Dark Dice Podcast even posted a character illustration of Balmur, inspired by Jeff Goldblum, on their Twitter page.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Dark Dice is an improvised audio drama created using the 5th edition rules of <a href=#>Dungeons & Dragons</a>, with NPC’s dialogues and text replaced by an entire voice cast crew, including Goldblum. The flow of the audio drama and its outcome will be directly determined by the rolling of the game’s dice. In addition to searching for his daughter’s missing locket, Jeff Goldblum’s team will be stalked by The Silent One, a deceptive entity who steals the faces and voices of anyone it comes across.</p><p>Similar to a radio drama, the role-playing podcast features immersive soundscapes, an original soundtrack featuring an orchestra with over thirty medieval instruments, and a live choir singing in several phantasy languages, including Infernal, Icelandic, and Elvish. The storylines of the new Dungeons & Dragons Dark Dice will also carry an unexpected emotional depth that unravels in each fan-funded episode released monthly on all podcasting platforms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jeff-goldblum-grandmaster-guardians-900x500.jpg><p>The Dark Dice podcast is created by Fool & Scholar Production, playing the Dungeons & Dragons adventure <a href=#>Domain of the Nameless God</a>, which was co-written by Fool & Scholar’s very own Travis Vengroff and Kaitlin Statz. The husband-and-wife duo is responsible for several other well-received shows in the podcast industry, including The White Vault, VAST Horizon, and Dark Dice. It’s worth noting that the couple assumed NPC roles (non-playable characters), with Vengroff as the Game Master and Statz as the drama’s Sister Tsavorite Cavernsfall.</p><p>Despite never playing an actual wizard or a sorcerer (Grandmaster isn’t using magic), Jeff Goldblum has several voicing gigs under his belt. He’s voicing Dr. Armstrong in the upcoming <a href=#>The Boss Baby: Family Business</a>, Aaron in The Prince of Egypt, and Duke in Isle of Dogs. He starred in some of the highest-grossing movies in his era, credited for appearing in more than 136 titles in his career. The acclaimed actor and musician received over 11 awards and over 27 nominations, including the Best Actor Award for his lead role in <a href=#>The Fly</a>. Tune in to Dark Dice on May 12, and you may hear Goldblum’s charming voice as the elven sorcerer Balmur.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8aapJ6rX5%2Byp7KMoKalnJKhwq55w66loJ2fo8BusNGanqimo2O1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./janna-lapidus-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Janna Lapidus Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
