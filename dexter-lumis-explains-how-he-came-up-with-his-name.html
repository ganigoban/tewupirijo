However,&nbsp;<a href=#>Lumis and nine other NXT stars&nbsp;</a>were released by WWE earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Dexter Lumis made his return back in August, much to the delight of fans. Since then, he has been involved in a very one-sided storyline with The Miz. It continues even now.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>MCW Backstage Pass</a>, Lumis discussed the process of choosing a new WWE name. He revealed that his name is a homage to the classic movie called ‘Halloween.’</p><p>“It’s just, hey, you get an email and it’s like, hey pitch us five names. Anything but your own name and the intellectual property. So I basically just, I didn’t initially have the name ‘Dexter Lumis.’ I had it in the list.</p><p>“I don’t even know if it was Dexter Lumis, it may have been like ‘Dexter Shawshank’ or something. But the writers seemed to like ‘Dexter Lumis.’ Lumis was a play on Dr. ‘Loomis’ from Halloween, we just spelled it different for trademark reasons and whatnot.</p><p>“So I was always a big fan of the horror movie genre. ‘Halloween’ is one of my favorite horror movies from the 70s, early 80s. Dr. Loomis, Sam Loomis, that was the guy who I sort of based that name on, and Dexter obviously being the famous TV show, the vigilante serial killer that kills bad people.”</p><p>Lumis has yet to wrestle for WWE since returning to the company. On the September 26 edition of Raw, Lumis attacked The Miz and his band of ‘Miz-Force’ security guards. We’ll have to see when he’ll wrestle again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ze5BpZmlrX5myucDEq2SlrZ2ewG6x16mjmqGeqHqpu9Zmn55lk5a6pnnUqWSwoaSdeqm10malmqWVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deryck-whibley-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Deryck Whibley Net Worth 2024</span></a>
