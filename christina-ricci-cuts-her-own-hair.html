But Christina has ditched her black tresses in favour of lighter hues of late, and has shared that she actually likes to trim her mane herself.</p><p id=epOJQIz9h1TR data-wc=29>"I also cut my own hair," she told Into The Gloss. "I use a hair cutting razor - I think that's what it's called? I practiced a good amount."</p><p id=ePdrmaY3VjM5 data-wc=50>The 37-year-old was last seen in period drama Z: The Beginning of Everything, in which she played American socialite and writer Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald. For the part, Christina rocked a curly, blonde hairstyle and she admits that she is very careful to try and protect her hair from styling damage.</p><p id=eZMvj7U4LKjS><a class=hm-link href=#>The best hairstyles for short hair</a></p><p id=ev523SIpWFbB data-wc=78>"I'm obsessed with this guy Christophe Robin, he makes the best products. The Cleansing Mask is so good, I could wash my hair with it every day and it wouldn't strip it.

And while Christina is open to trying lots of new hair products, she remains a big fan of Sebastian Potion 9 - a styling treatment she has been using since she was 13 years old.</p><p id=eK5OCVGUSlw0 data-wc=46>"It's a leave-in conditioner treatment and it's the best product ever,” she explained. "It dries hard, and so if your hair is damaged or frizzy, it doesn't let the frizz happen. Then when you run your fingers through it just holds whatever position it dries in."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9lmlsa2pjbn51g46cn6uho6m2r62Mq6Ccm5lisLbA0mafnqpdpMSveceaoKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrity-teeth-transformations-before-after-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrity teeth transformations: Dramatic before-and-after photos Kanye West, Demi Moore, Nicole</span></a>
