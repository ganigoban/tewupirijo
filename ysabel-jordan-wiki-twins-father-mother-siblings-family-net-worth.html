They both have a daughter and two sons.</span></p><p><span>After filing for divorce twice, the couple was finally formalized in December 2006, and Juanita Vanoy was awarded $168 million, which was considered the biggest celebrity settlement at the time.</span></p><p><span>On Christmas 2011, Jordan proposed to his current wife and mother of twins Yvette Prieto.&nbsp;Two years later, the engaged couple took him to Bethesday-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church where they were married.</span></p><p><strong><span>Michael Jordan Awards</span></strong></p><p><span>Here’s a look at the awards Michael Jordan has won over the years.&nbsp;We think these are his most prestigious awards and should be at the top of the list.</span></p><ul><li><span>He won the NBA championship 6 times</span></li><li><span>He was not only the NBA Most Valuable Player five times, but also the NBA Most Valuable Player in a Finals six times.</span></li><li><span>He won the NBA Slam Dunk contest twice.</span></li><li><span>He won the NBA championship 10 times.</span></li></ul><h2><strong><span>Ysabel Jordan&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Mother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Yvette Prieto, the mother of Ysabel Jordan is a model from Cuba.&nbsp;She married Michael Jordan in Palm Beach, Florida where their twins were conceived in April 2013. Ysabel Jordan is 16 years younger than her husband, Jordan.&nbsp;The pair met while having fun at a club in 2008.</span></p><p><span>Although the couple only got married in 2013, they had already been living together since 2009.&nbsp;Their wedding was performed by some of the biggest names in music and her wedding dress was designed by J’Aton Couture.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Siblings and family</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ysabel Jordan and her twin sister have joined the family of three (Jeffrey Jordan, 28, Marcus Jordan, 26, and Jasmine, 24).&nbsp;This makes a total of 5 Jordan children (2 boys and 3 girls) from the two wives.</span></p><p><span>Jordan’s first wife, Juanita Vanoy, is the mother of three adult children, who divorced in 2006 after a 17-year marriage record.</span></p><p><strong><span>Cousins:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Alexis Jordan, Justin Jordan</span></p><p><strong><span>Grandparents:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;James R. Jordan, Sr., Deloris Jordan, Carlos Prieto, Maria Prieto</span></p><h2><span>Grandfather – James Raymond Jordan</span></h2><p><span>James R. Jordan was the father of Michael Jordan.&nbsp;He died in 1993, before Ysabel Jordan was born.&nbsp;James was known to be a huge baseball fan, inspiring his son Michael to become a professional player.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Michael went the basketball route;&nbsp;his father nevertheless supported him.</span></p><p><strong><span>Uncles:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;James Jordan Jr., Larry Jordan</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>While it’s common to see celebrity kids making money from an early age through endorsements and other deals, Ysabel Jordan didn’t, mostly because her parents tried to protect her. media and paparazzi that constantly accompany their celebrity status.&nbsp;Therefore, Ysabel Jordan’s net worth currently depends on her father’s achievements over the years.</span></p><p><span>His father, Michael Jordan, is currently bringing in around $1.4 billion from his basketball career, endorsement deals, and other investments.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGixo5avpriMo6arnJGjeri1yqJkra%2BZo8BussCtn56qXaK8tbTEq2SsoZKhtq%2Bz0madmqWZocZuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wwe-doesnt-want-fans-thinking-randy-orton-will-return-at-wrestlemania-39.html><span>←</span><span>WWE Doesnt Want Fans Thinking Randy Orton Will Return At WrestleMania 39</span></a>
