A few years after his divorce, Faison was introduced to his future wife, Cacee Cobb, at Zach Braff's 30th birthday party. Unlike Braff, or most of the people at the party, Cobb wasn't an actor. At the time, she was a brand manager but was connected to Braff through her long working relationship with Jessica Simpson, per <a href=#>Martha Stewart</a>. Cobb served as Simpson's assistant for years. The association even led to Cobb appearing on more than a few of Simpson's reality shows, including "Undateable," and "The Price of Beauty." per&nbsp;<a href=#>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Cobb's disinterest in acting or performing perhaps helped to ensure that her relationship with Faison wasn't just another celebrity marriage. Though she was busy pursuing her own career, it wasn't long until Cobb put it on hold, thanks to the arrival of their two kids. Rocco and Wilder. At just 14 months apart, and helping to co-parent Faison's three kids from his previous marriage, Cobb certainly had her hands full. "[I tell him], 'I need you to move this, I need you to move that. Pick up this, help me with this,'" she joked to <a href=#>People</a>. "When I go home, I'm her b****,"&nbsp;Faison (quite candidly) noted.</p><p dir=ltr>Hence, Cobb fully supported Faison's decision to get a vasectomy in 2017. She commemorated the moment with an <a href=#>Instagram post</a> appropriately captioned, "Snip, Snip!" They seem really sweet together!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWtlZ4N1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2ZvK%2Bty51kn5mZqLyvv4ywoJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-products-for-gray-hair.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Haircare and Styling Products for Gray Hair</span></a>
