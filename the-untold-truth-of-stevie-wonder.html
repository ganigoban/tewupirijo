Born six weeks premature, he <a href=#>received oxygen therapy</a>, which had the then-unknown side effect of causing blindness in premature babies. Despite what many might consider a tragic accident, Wonder "never thought of being blind as a disadvantage." In 2012, <a href=#>he told the Guardian</a>, "I love me! And I don't mean that egotistically –- I love that God has allowed me to take whatever it was that I had and to make something out of it."</p><p>Throughout his life Wonder has greeted the world with fearless enthusiasm. As a kid he got into fights over girls and once <a href=#>leaped off the roof</a> of a shed in his backyard. As an adult he went to movies, went bowling, and even navigated airports by himself. <a href=#>According to one of his assistants</a>, people on airplanes thought Wonder was "a junkie 'cause he sits there with these glasses on, and his head goes back and forth, side to side when he feels good."</p><p>Some of Wonder's feats have been surreal. In 1973, he told Rolling Stone, "I've flown a plane before. A Cessna or something, from Chicago to New York. Scared the hell out of everybody." During a trip to Ghana, he not only steered but landed a 10-seater plane simply by following instructions given by the pilot. "The sensitivity of his hands was unbelievable," <a href=#>the pilot recalled</a>. Stevie's a Wonder, all right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k21scnBfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2owabCyJ5ksKeembKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./untold-truth-dr-dre.html><span>←</span><span>The Untold Truth Of Dr. Dre</span></a>
