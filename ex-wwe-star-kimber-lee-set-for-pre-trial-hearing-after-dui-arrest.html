She would eventually part ways with WWE and is now slated for a pre-trial hearing following a DUI arrest this year.</p><p>As previously reported, Kimber Lee was arrested on May 11th and charged with DUI, <a href=#>Resisting an Officer with Violence and Battery on Law Enforcement Officer</a>. According to PWInsider, Kimber Lee is set for a pre-trial hearing on October 24th in Highlands County Court stemming from the aforementioned DUI arrest.</p><p>In the police report about the incident, officer P.J. Roberts noted how a gray Kis Soul faced the wrong direction and stopped in the northbound lane on May 11th. It was then said that the vehicle then drove over the lane onto the paved shoulder and “almost collided with the face of the guard rail.”</p><p>After a frantic chase, the police officer identified Kimber Lee and described her as having “bloodshot watery eyes, and she slurred as she spoke. After more hassles, Roberts stated that Kimber Lee tried “several times” to leave the area.</p><p>The officer then tried to cuff her when she struck him in the chest to prevent him from doing so. He arrested her for battery and while putting on the other handcuff, she violently resisted and ended up injuring the officer. It was evident that she was heavily intoxicated. After getting arrested, a breathalyzer revealed she gave a sample of .140, when the legal limit in the State of Florida is .08.</p><p>She entered a plea of not guilty to all charges on July 7th and waived her rights to a speedy trial due to not being able to afford a lawyer. The charges of Resisting an Officer with Violence as well as battery of a law enforcement officer are third-degree felonies and both hold a maximum jail time of 5 years each.</p><p>Kimber Lee last wrestled in October last year and while she has been active on social media following her arrest, Lee has not made any mention of the arrest whatsoever. It remains to be seen whether she will end up behind bars as there are some serious charges against her.</p><p>What do you make of this shocking story concerning Kimber Lee? Do you think she will be behind bars for a long time?
