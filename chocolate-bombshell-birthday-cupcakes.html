I use Callebaut Cocoa (which I find in the bulk section at Winco). Ghirardelli and Trader Joe’s make good ones as well. Always use unsweetened cocoa powder.</li><li>Using both <strong>baking soda and baking powder</strong> gives it the best rise.</li><li><strong>Buttermilk</strong> is a must because it gives it the melt-in-your-mouth texture.</li><li>Even though I am the biggest butter fan in the world, <strong>oil just works best in chocolate cakes</strong> (in my humble opinion). I have used both canola and coconut oils and both turn out beautifully. When I use melted coconut oil, there is surprisingly no coconut oil taste in the cake.</li><li><strong>Don’t overbake your cake</strong>. You want that moist, tender crumb so watch it carefully and test it with a cake tester or toothpick.</li><li>When making your <strong>chocolate buttercream</strong>, you may substitute half and half or whole milk for the cream. &nbsp;If you are using whole milk, use a little less as it is thinner than cream.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DSC_0698-copy.jpg alt="Chocolate Bombshell Birthday Cupcakes.
