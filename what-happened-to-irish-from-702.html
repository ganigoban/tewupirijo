Despite the challenges and eventual disbandment of the group, Irish’s legacy as part of 702 remains influential. Her departure from the group led her down a path of personal exploration and growth. While she has maintained a lower profile compared to her days in the spotlight with 702, her fans continue to remember her contributions fondly. The possibility of a reunion, while uncertain, keeps the hope alive for those who cherish the era of 90s R&B that 702 so vividly represents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qq3MoKalnKCWu6WtjZympmenna61eceap6mdnpqxbsDOZqCroaOdeqe%2BzqZkcGhiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-bryson-tiller.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Bryson Tiller?</span></a>
