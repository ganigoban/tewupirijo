"[It] made me realize that all I care about is how happy and healthy she lives her life," Ritter said — so he called her. Somers recalled the conversation, saying, "He said, 'I miss you. I love you. I'm sorry,'" adding that she&nbsp;"said the same things."</p><p>Somers and DeWitt reunited on Somers' show, <a href=#>"Breaking Through,"</a> in 2012. <a href=#>TV Guide</a> says that it was the first time they'd gotten together since the end of "Three's Company," and it was tear-jerking stuff. Apologies were said, and admissions were made: Somers admitted she had been overwhelmed and felt surrounded by serious actors, and was afraid that she wasn't worthy of being in the show. DeWitt spoke candidly about her fear of fame and discomfort with the others, and in the end, they hugged, found middle ground, and were grateful to reconnect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kG9ua3BjZMGpvsSeqmabn6K9orrYZphmpJ%2BkuG6uwJyiZpmkYsGpsYyhoK1lo57BpLvMaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./braided-hairstyle-ideas-for-black-women.html><span>←</span><span>20 Black Braided Hairstyles Ideas</span></a>
