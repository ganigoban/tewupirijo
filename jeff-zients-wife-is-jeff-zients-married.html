Zients attended St. Albans School prep school and furthered his education at Duke University where he graduated with a degree in political science in 1988.</p><p>Before becoming a government official, Zients was an executive at firms including The Advisory Board Company and CEB. As a government official, he served as the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget in 2010 and from 2012 to 2013.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>READ ALSO: <a href=#>Jeff Zients Bio, Parents, Wife, Children, Siblings</a></h4><p>Zients was also the director of the National Economic Council from February 2014 to January 2017. From January 2021 to April 2022, he served as both Counselor to the President and Coordinator of the COVID-19 response in the Biden administration.</p><p>In January 2023, he made major headlines when he was officially designated to serve as the Chief of Staff at the White House. He will replace Ron Klain, who has run President Biden’s White House since the president took office 2 years ago.</p><p>Ron Klain (the current White House Chief Of Staff) will step down after the State of the Union address on Tuesday, February 7, 2023. Sources say the change at the top may bring about other shifts in the coming weeks ahead of the 2024 election.</p><p>Jeff Zients is an entrepreneur and management consultant who organized the largest vaccination campaign in American history. He’s regarded in the president (Biden) circles as a strong and capable technocratic leader.</p><p>However, sources say, he has little political experience to oversee a presidential campaign. His selection, therefore, suggests that the president could lean on Mr. Zients to help run the government while other advisers focus on the politics of winning a 2nd term.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jeff Zients Wife: Is Jeff Zients Married?</h2><p>Jeff Zients is a happily married man. He’s married to Mary Menell. She grew up in South Africa and came to the U.S. to attend high school.</p><p>Zients and his wife, Mary co-founded The Urban Alliance Foundation, a non-profit organization that partners with corporations to provide economically disadvantaged youth with year-round paid internships, adult mentors, and job training.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/23060245/Jeff-Zients-Wife-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOcn55dr7amutOsZLChlpp6qr%2BMo5yfnl2vtqa606xkppmip7amsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./javier-mascherano-net-worth-154510.html><span>←</span><span>Javier Mascherano Net Worth</span></a>
