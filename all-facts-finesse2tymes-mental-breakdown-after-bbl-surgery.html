Butttttt he need to worry bout his girlfriend (bm) takin [pills] I been gone from round yall for months! Why yall still worry bout me??”</p><p>She continued: “Worry about healing from the bbl you just got [laughing emoji] I try to not do no internet sh.t cause it’s soooooo much I can say I been trying not to say but today’s the day.”</p><p>Her post comes just days after the 31-year-old rapper announced that he will be committing to one partner moving forward, FNG Shugga.</p><p>“I’m focusing on @fng_shugga only,” he wrote on Instagram Stories. “I don’t need 2-3 women no more, i got kids, That shyt ain’t what’s up, and nah this ain’t about no babymama shyt, All my bm’s know I take care mine, here or not. [100 emoji, dua emoji]”</p><p>Just last month, Finesse2Tymes was flaunting his pregnant girlfriends as&nbsp;he shared some sexually suggestive photos with one of them.</p><p>In early October, the “Warfare” hitmaker posted images with Nia Love to Instagram (these have since been deleted) in which the pair showed off her baby bump. Aside from doing the usual happy-couple poses, they even took the time to do a few risqué ones.</p><p>“I’m just a man that need alotta love,” he wrote in the caption, to which she replied: “I Love you Papa Bear.”</p><p>His breakup with BBJay came in September, just before the pregnancy announcements.</p><p>The Memphis rapper took to Instagram in September with a photo dump where he revealed in the caption she had been cut out of the picture due to loose lips. He didn’t name names, but it was clear who he was referring to soon after.</p><p>“She was tawkn to much got eliminated, I told u don’t speak on what u saw,” he wrote.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
