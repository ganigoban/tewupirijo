"I always thought I was going to get married or maybe I thought I was going to have a kid by 29", she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6eb99bc5833d-gettyimages-1456651474.jpg><p id=esjN4YzOEFM data-wc=55>But by the time Angela reached 29, she found that there was no partner - but her career was taking off in a way that she was really happy about instead. It was nine years later, when she was 38, that Angela reconnected with Courtney who she had met at the Yale School of Drama.</p><p id=esTwRrfvwJP data-wc=64>"When I met Courtney, I had known him in drama school, was very enamored of his talents, his gift on stage, and just him as a person, just a real sweetheart, found him to be supportive", Angela told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a>.

It's work, it's understanding, it's apologizing. Our phrase is, 'If you mess up, fess up.' If you mess it up, it's okay.
