And I already tagged him, he's pinned at the bottom."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Angelina ">Read more on Angelina</h2><p>The surgeon then chimed in to explain: "So what we're doing today is a revision of her breast lift. Angelina has lost a good amount of weight recently and it's caused her breast tissue to kinda sag over the implant, and so we're going to revise that and make it better."</p><p>The <a href=#>MTV</a> star continued: "Yes, so he's pinned to the bottom. Follow him please."</p><p>Angelina then watched as fans flooded the comments section with questions.</p><p>After one asked if she had lost a bunch of weight due to Ozempic, she replied: "Am I on ozempic? No I'm not. I'm not on it, I've just lost a lot of weight."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The Staten Island native then pulled down her top to show off a bunch of black lines that had been drawn from her chest down her bust.</p><p>"So as you guys can see, we have the road map already ready to go. Right? And so we're going to go into surgery and he will take a few pictures and he will post them so just follow him and you will see some of the videos.</p><p>"We will not show my face, but we will show the skin It might be a little gory for some of you but I don't really care, you guys will like it."</p><p>Angelina waited for a few more comments, and one fan asked: "You're super skinny how did you lose it all?"</p><p>"Guys it was just stress-related, I don't really think there was a reason for it. And no it's not Ozempic cause somebody said that again. I guess it's just being on TV and I don't even know how to explain it right, like you lose weight sometimes and it is what it is, what am I going to do?" she responded.</p><p>Directing her attention back to Doctor Tutela, she gushed: "He's the best plastic surgeon, he's done my nose, my boobs, he's doing my boobs again, cause of everything, weight loss. So love him. He's the best!"</p><p>She captioned the post: "After unexpected weight loss due to stress, my breast started to sag again. I went to see <a href=#>@tutelaps</a> for a revision breast lift with implants. While he was there I decided to upsize too.</p><p>"Check out his story <a href=#>@tutelapls</a> for intraoperative details."</p><h2>NEW CURVES</h2><p>After her surgery, Angelina snapped a Boomerang in the foyer of the office with a friend, showing off her major transformation.</p><p>The TV star wore a black sports bra that clung tightly to her now-larger breasts.</p><p>She paired the look with black leggings and sneakers as she posed next to her buddy.</p><p>Doctor Tutela also <a href=# aria-label="shared a photo (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a photo</a> of Angelina's final product, with the top half of her face cut off.</p><p>In the selfie taken by the Jersey Shore star, she showed off her dramatic new cleavage in a white lacy bralette.</p><p>The brunette paired the look with gold sweatpants, flaunting her flat tummy and tattoos across her midsection.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Angelina's lips looked puffy and huge, and she accessorized with gold hoop earrings.</p><p>The Jersey Shore star has been frequenting the plastic surgeon's office and recently <a href=#>underwent a non-surgical facelift.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/natural-jersey-shore-star-angelina-713864983.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/jersey-shores-angelina-pivarnick-undergoes-843721844.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/jersey-shore-fans-wince-angelina-824782268.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYGmGc4WQaKGeqqOaxm6%2Fx6ipnqtdlruoscuipZploJ7Dor7NopqkZaWjsaa%2BxqicrGWSpLyjecmomWaomKTBsL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jermaine-crawford-net-worth-78710.html><span>←</span><span>Jermaine Crawford Net Worth</span></a>
