Despite the love many had for his work, he doesn't seem to be all that much of a fan of hip-hop himself. In a new interview reflecting on his legacy, legendary producer Swizz Beats explained why DMX's albums rarely had features. "The reason he didn't like so many features is cause he was just competitive as an artist," Swizz explains. "He only wanted people on his album he was a real big fan of. And mind you, X wasn't a fan of too many rap artists. He was a fan of Earth, Wind & Fire, he was a fan of R&B music."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Very few rappers had the chance to feature on a DMX album. The ones that did were often legends of their era like The LOX, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Styles P</a>, Mase, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Swizz Beatz</a> himself. His posthumously released album Exodus featured some of those artists and many more legends who paid tribute to his influence. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>, Nas, Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, and more showed up to tribute the late legend.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-why-dmx-didn-t-use-many-features>Why DMX Didn't Use Many Features</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Swizz Beatz has been putting in the work to keep DMX's legacy alive. Last month <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he shared some old clips</a> of the rapper performing various tracks from his classic album It's Dark And Hell Is Hot at the Apollo. Swizz also said in an interview that he thought X may have <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">had something to do with Swizz finding his new prodigy</a>. He's recently taken NY rapper Scar Lip under his wing and credits DMX with some kind of influence over it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this year, his most beloved project It's Dark And Hell Is Hot celebrated its 35th birthday. The album was an instant smash that hit number one on the Billboard 200 and spawned the hit song "Ruff Ryders' Anthem." Many fans and fellow rappers alike took the opportunity <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">to shout out the influential project</a> on its birthday.
