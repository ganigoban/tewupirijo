However, his quest for conquering championship gold is still left unfulfilled with Knight open to pursuing titles he has not gone after before reaching, what he believes, is his ultimate plan.</p><p>During a recent conversation with <a href=#>Baby Huey on the In The Kliq podcast</a>, WWE’s resident Megastar claimed that he entered the business to become a champion and not a background player. Moreover, he aimed to go after the position currently held by the Tribal Chief, Roman Reigns as the marquee attraction for the company.</p><p>“Look, for me, again, I never got into this to be a background player. I want to be the guy and in order to do that, I need to be the champion. I need to be the WWE Champion, ‘THE guy.’ Right now, I feel like Roman Reigns is holding that role. Some could say it’s Seth Rollins, but I look at that streak that Roman Reigns is on and he’s holding, and I want that.&nbsp;“</p><p>Furthermore, LA Knight was not opposed to the idea of going after other WWE titles as a stepping stone to ascend to the top level.</p><p>“Now, am I opposed to, on the way there, doing it the old way of [getting] that US Championship or Intercontinental Championship as a proving ground, as a stepping stone, to getting there? Look, man, I told everybody from day one, I’m coming in for gold. Nobody’s gonna stop me from that. So if that means US Title on the way, Intercontinental Championship, on the way, or whatever, I mean, I’m game for it. At the end of the day, I’m looking for that top spot.”</p><p>LA Knight displayed an excellent showing against Roman Reigns at WWE Crown Jewel 2023, nearly beating him for his Undisputed WWE Universal title. With the audience firmly behind him in his YEAH! movement, it would be interesting to see if he does get a title shot on, perhaps the biggest show in history coming up, WrestleMania 40.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Do you want to see LA Knight compete in a title match at WrestleMania?
