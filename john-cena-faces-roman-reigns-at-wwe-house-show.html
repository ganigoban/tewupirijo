John Cena partnered up with Dominik and Rey Mysterio to beat Roman Reigns and The Usos.</p><p>Towards the end of the match, John Cena hit the Tribal Chief with an Attitude Adjustment. He went on to hit another Attitude Adjustment on one of The Usos and won the match for his team.</p><p>Roman Reigns rejected John Cena’s challenge for a WWE Universal Championship match at the WWE SummerSlam pay-per-view as he chose Finn Balor as his opponent instead. We will have to see if Cena will eventually find his way into the match or not. Odds are Cena vs Reigns is going to happen at SummerSlam, because the<a href=#> match is already reportedly “locked in.”</a></p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
