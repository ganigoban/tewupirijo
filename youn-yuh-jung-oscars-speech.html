When she took the stage, I was struck by her dewy skin, her brilliant silver hair, and the titanic sapphire ring on her delicate hand. And this was all before she skewered Brad Pitt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pitt's Plan B production company produced Minari, the film for which Yuh-Jung earned her Oscar. Apparently, he wasn't around much. "Mr. Brad Pitt, finally," she quipped as she received her statue from the handsome boy. "Nice to meet you, where were you when we were filming?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following presenter banter is usually the part of the speech when winners do a lot of "wows" and "oh my gods" and heavy breathing into the mic. Yuh-Jung went in a different direction. "As you know, I'm from Korea and actually my name is Yuh-Jung Youn," she said. "Most European people call me Yuh-Young and some of them call me Yoo-Jung. But, tonight, you are all forgiven."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sorry, Brad (and all of us Americans)! Not even your man bun could protect your ego from that devastating blow!</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The audacity to come at America's national treasure with both fists swinging was simply the pre-show entertainment. After an awards season marked by awkward Zoom small talk and heavy conversations about diversity and representation in the industry, Yuh-Jung embodied the "fuck it" energy of the rest of us watching at home — those who couldn't help but feel lethargic and dissociated while watching the one percent socialize in designer dresses at a celebration for individuals who (generally speaking) take themselves too seriously.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So when she mocked Brad, we laughed. When she thanked her two boys for "making me go out and work," and then held up her Oscar, adding, "this is the result — because mommy worked so hard," we were giddy with the LOLS. When she told 8-time Oscar nominee, 0-time winner Glenn Close that she was "luckier than you," we eeped at her frankness. (It came to my attention that she recently apologized for calling the British <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>"snobbish people" at their own awards show</a> and if that is not Big Auntie Energy, I don't know what is.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In conclusion: Give Yuh-Jung another Oscar already! A starring role in literally anything! At the very least, she deserves her own hour-long Netflix special. She's an Oscar-winner, after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wLCYq5yjYrK3sc2tqmixn6q7bsXUoWSjrZ6cerC%2FwpqprGWjpbKmr8c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yellowstone-season-5-dutton-foe-html.html><span>←</span><span>Yellowstone Just Brought Back A Crucial Dutton Foe</span></a>
