But she almost did. Eve began her professional life in television production, but that's not where her heart was. While she worked, Eve&nbsp;began exploring her passion for the arts. In&nbsp;1991, she&nbsp;took a ceramics class in her native New York. Eventually, Eve decided to turn her passion into a career. In the early '90s, Eve&nbsp;studied crafts and design at Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning in Ontario, Canada.</p><p>In 1995, she took her work to the next level, spending a year in Florence, Italy, studying&nbsp;ceramics, painting, and art history at the Studio Arts Centers International. Clay provided the best medium for Eve to both express her vision and connect with the audience. "Utilitarian ceramic art provides a direct link of connectivity between the maker and the user," she wrote on her <a href=#>website</a>.&nbsp;Now Eve runs her own ceramics studio&nbsp;from her home in&nbsp;Sag Harbor, New York.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, Eve has owned the home since May 2021, when her mother transferred the five-bed, four-bath estate to her.

"[I] was lucky to live next to Forest Park and loved exploring what seemed like deep woods," she <a href=#>wrote</a>, describing her childhood.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtnbH52go6jprJlkpq1or6MnZiun5ipsrN5xK%2BcZpmcoXqovs6wpWatoGK7sL7MmqNmpJmbsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jon-call-net-worth-291570.html><span>←</span><span>Jon Call Net Worth</span></a>
