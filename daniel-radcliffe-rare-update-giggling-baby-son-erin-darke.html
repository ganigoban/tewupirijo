"<strong>He's very cute,"</strong> Daniel said of his son in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Extra&nbsp;</a>before the <a class=hm-link href=#>SAG-AFTRA strike</a>. <strong>"We've moved into a less screaming phase and he's now giving us little smiles and giggling.</strong>"&nbsp;</p><p id=eUbUnJ9Nnyp data-wc=50>Speaking about the transition into fatherhood, Daniel added: "It's been a crazy few months, as anyone who's been through parenthood would attest. But it's also the literal best thing that's ever happened, so it's great. I feel very lucky to be able to have this time with him. It's awesome."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b17929cc3471-daniel-radcliffe-girlfriend-erin-darke.jpg><p id=eUJcKrJyOE data-wc=54>Daniel and Erin, who first started dating in 2012, revealed they had welcomed a child after photos of them pushing a stroller were published. A spokesperson for Daniel confirmed the couple's happy news in a statement to <strong></strong>! It read: "We can confirm that Erin Darke and Daniel Radcliffe have welcomed their first child."&nbsp;</p><p id=e2cSaLYaXTN data-wc=40>Daniel recently gushed over how quickly his little one started smiling, telling <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News:&nbsp;</a>"He's smiling and that's all I need. Like, that's awesome. Some people have to wait a lot longer for that, so I'm really happy with that."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/642a61f458de-daniel-radcliffe-erin-darke.jpg><p id=eugVIWmd5iq data-wc=33>Praising Erin, he said: "Watching my girlfriend become a mom is really the most incredible, beautiful thing to be witness to. So, it's great. It's a crazy thing, but it's also really beautiful."&nbsp;</p><p id=erml88DoXR data-wc=82>Becoming a dad has changed Daniel's outlook on his career too. Earlier this month he admitted that he will now become more selective about his future roles so he can spend as much time with his son as possible. "I'm sure I'm going to probably, for at least a few years, become a little more selective about how much I work just because I really enjoy spending time with him and I'd like to continue doing that," he added to the publication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/98a25f2dbd35-gettyimages-1052522728.jpg><p id=eTU-bjEh4X data-wc=14>"But obviously, I love my job and I'm not going to stop doing that."&nbsp;</p><p id=effJnTyI1L data-wc=49>Similarly, he previously told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ET&nbsp;</a>about taking time off work: "I was always going to take some time off, which not everyone is able to do, and so I'm able to kind of just be here with him a lot, which is lovely. So, we're having a great time."&nbsp;</p><p id=eUyuFHhxK53 data-wc=33>He continued: "It hasn't really yet affected things, but I really like spending time with him, and I think I'm gonna miss him when I go back to work later in the year."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e3d7f25b3e9c-daniel-radcliffe-erin-darke.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx1hZdpbHFnlJa7qrHLZqmanJOhtqeyxGapmqqVYsKxsMCtnGafmZy0rbXNoGSbmZKuerS7zWacq6GeYrGivsqeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./current-status-of-wwe-summerslam-ticket-sales-at-detroits-ford-field.html><span>←</span><span>Current Status of WWE SummerSlam Ticket Sales at Detroits Ford Field</span></a>
