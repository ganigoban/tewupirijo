"Joanna is happy with the settlement and has no regrets. Joanna hopes she has inspired action instead of indifference."</p><p>While the exact terms of the settlement remain confidential, it seems that a public apology may have been required. Glanville told <a href=#>TMZ</a>, "I want to apologize to Joanna Krupa for the statements I have made about her. I regret ever making such statements about Joanna Krupa; I also certainly never intended my statements to be taken so seriously and out of proportion."</p><p>The 44-year-old continued, "I apologize as I never wanted my statements to affect Joanna Krupa's reputation and I wish her nothing but continued success in life."</p><p>Krupa previously sued Glanville for slander after she appeared on a November 2013 episode of Bravo's <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>, during which Glanville claimed that Krupa, 38, had had sex with Mohamed Hadid while he was married to Yolanda Foster. Glanville also alleged that Krupa's "p****y smelled."</p><p>Glanville later doubled down on these statements in a December 2014 YouTube video. "You can't help the odor situation," she stated (via <a href=#>E! News</a>), regarding rumors about the smell of Krupa's vagina.</p><p>In January 2015, Krupa filed the defamation lawsuit against Glanville, claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking a minimum of $15,000 in damages.</p><p>Want more reality TV star dirt? <a href=#>Here are all of the Real Housewives' biggest secrets</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHBjaIRwvsSao2agn6rApsPIr5ysZZqkrq%2B6wGaiq62glnqjvsCnm6Jll6Gur8LIpaOeZaOawbW4xGabnp6Roq61tc6nZKWZp6jCqsCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./penelope-cruz-white-sequin-chanel-gown-governors-awards.html><span>←</span><span>Penlope Cruz Is a Dream Bride in This Sequin-Embroidered Chanel Gown</span></a>
