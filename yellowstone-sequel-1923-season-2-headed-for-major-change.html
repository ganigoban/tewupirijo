The new series, which stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, will swap its familiar Montana set for a new location in South Austin, Texas.&nbsp;
Episodes will be filmed at ATX Film Studios, according to Austin Business Journal. While in season one, the majority of filming took place in Bozeman town in the city of Butte in Montana, with other scenes were shot throughout Europe, South Africa, and Tanzania, it's currently unclear whether locations outside Texas will be used in series two."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Gallagher, the chief executive of Butte-Silver Bow County, shared his reaction to the news with the <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Montana Standard</a>. "<strong>The decision to film the Yellowstone series of 1923 in Texas is disappointing</strong>," he began. "Nevertheless, we respect the production team's decision and acknowledge that these choices are influenced by factors beyond our control. We were in talks with the production about 1923 coming back to Butte because of the positive experience they had here, but state tax incentive programs were a major factor for the production to move to Texas."</p><p id=eeyprGWtChZ data-wc=65>The show's move to Texas may come as a surprise to fans as Montana is an integral part of the show's identity. For those who don't know, the spin-off follows on from the first prequel series, , which stars Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, and looks at the Dutton family's ancestry in the late 19th century as they made their way from Texas to Montana.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1dbac7e1be27-1923-season-1.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">MORE YELLOWSTONE STARS</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Yellowstone: Kevin Costner’s exit drama explained" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4958be5b39af-gettyimages-1152755734.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Yellowstone: Kevin Costner’s exit drama explained" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Yellowstone: Kevin Costner’s exit drama explained</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Before they were Duttons – The Yellowstone stars' most unbelievable throwback photos" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/98cc8f29a362-throwback-photos-yellowstone-cast.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Before they were Duttons – The Yellowstone stars' most unbelievable throwback photos" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Before they were Duttons – The Yellowstone stars' most unbelievable throwback photos</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Did you spot Kevin Costner's parents in these iconic movies?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9c39eed9be37-kevin-costner-with-his-parents.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Did you spot Kevin Costner's parents in these iconic movies?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Did you spot Kevin Costner's parents in these iconic movies?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet Harrison Ford's children – everything we know about his five kids" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/221156efb7c8-harrison-ford-calista-flockhart.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet Harrison Ford's children – everything we know about his five kids" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet Harrison Ford's children – everything we know about his five kids</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e6O1Qrg57Nz data-wc=33>focuses on a new generation of Duttons as they struggle to survive historic drought, lawlessness and prohibition, and an epidemic of cattle theft; all set against the backdrop of Montana's Great Depression.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Have you caught up on season 1?</figure><p id=emFWmYHFeoP data-wc=44>The show introduces "a new generation of the Dutton family and explores the early twentieth century when pandemics, historic drought, the end of Prohibition, and the Great Depression all plague the mountain west, and the Duttons who call it home," according to the synopsis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/982fd3a95156-1923-series-1.jpg><p id=exSejysMuF0 data-wc=30>Harrison and Helen lead the cast as Jacob Dutton and his wife Cara, while Brandon Sklenar, Darren Mann, Michelle Randolph, James Badge Dale, Marley Shelton, and Aminah Nieves also star.&nbsp;</p><p id=eM45eLqvtZI data-wc=47>Details on season two have been kept under wraps so far, with any news on the plot, cast and release date yet to be announced.
