I think it´s a group of young children, all following each other throughout elementary school and being best friends until they get to middle or high school where they branch out and make new friends.

Micheal ¨died¨, meaning he abandoned someone to follow the others until you broke off.</p><p>The red scarfs could be the memories keeping friends barely together, until one breaks loose the memories and makes their own new ones.</p><p>And the red blood (related to the red scarfs) could be the memories pouring out, reminding the others of your absence, and wishing you were there.</p><p>So in a summary, my thoughts are the pack is a friend group, and Micheal ¨died¨ by making new friends, and red blood and red scarfs are related as memories, the scarfs keeping you together, and blood as the reminder of the ones you´ve lost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZp%2BklZrBbrLOsZysZ6edtrWxjLCgp6yVp3qpxcynmKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simone-whitmore-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Dr Simone Whitmore Age, Sorority, Net Worth, Husband OBGYN Bio</span></a>
