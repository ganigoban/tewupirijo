According to a&nbsp;May 2020&nbsp;article from&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hollywood Gossip</a>, she recalled, "We were watching the scene and were like, 'Okay, this is over the top, I realize that but how can we resist?'" She added, "We asked [Scheana] in the interview, 'How young would you go [while dating someone]?' and we didn't tell her it was for the Nikolai scene, of course."</p><p>In May 2020,&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a> reported that she remarked, "If Scheana knew what was good for her, she'd befriend me because my favorite game is finding all of the embarrassing things that Scheana does and putting them all in. ... [The editors] joke that Scheana's memoir will be Death By a Million Embarrassments."</p><p>After catching heat for the podcast, the editor put her Instagram page on private. However, a fan account posted a screenshot of an announcement she shared on May 15, 2020. She wrote (via <a href=#>People</a>), "To any cast members who wanted me out: I'm out! But right behind me is another editor who does the same kind of work as me. And the nine other fantastic and highly skilled editors who also took part in creating this past season, and who will continue to do their jobs."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2ljaoNze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2ptaZ51ZqlnZ2ipcKuvIyrrKWdo2KypbXToqWgZaOYrq%2BwwKVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-bold-and-the-beautiful-spoilers-ingo-rademacher-out-as-thorne.html><span>←</span><span>The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers: Ingo Rademacher out as Thorne</span></a>
