"Using my name for likes and views. Meg wasn’t lying," one user wrote. Another added: "A place of anger?! Girl you weren’t shot. What was you angry for?"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kelsey-nicole-speaks-out>Kelsey Nicole Speaks Out</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for the shooting, Lanez was eventually convicted on all counts in relation to the attack.
