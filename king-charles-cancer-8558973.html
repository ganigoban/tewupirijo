For the time being, Charles will not be making any public appearances, and other senior royals are expected to step up while he's undergoing treatment. Charles, who is 75 years old, will continue his "constitutional role as head of state." He was last seen at a church service in Sandringham on Sunday.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>statement</a> from Buckingham Palace explained the situation:<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"During The King’s recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted.
