And if you're like me and you (unfortunately) were one of those tweenage mall-dwellers, you tossed your beloved pair(s) aside years ago only to see the boots re-enter the "model off duty" fashion scene present day — and you haven't known a moment of peace since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">ICYMI, Uggs are back, and supermodels can't get enough of them. Seriously, everyone from Joan Smalls to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gigi Hadid</a> have been spotted in Ultra-Mini Uggs over the past year, to the point where the boots are now considered an essential part of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>unofficial supermodel uniform for winter</a> (and something I need to have on my feet, like, now). If you're wanting to get in on the trend, but got rid of your OGs and aren't looking to dole out $150 on a new pair, we found an affordable option so similar, even your middle school self would be satisfied: The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cushionaire Memory Foam Boots</a> on Amazon.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $50; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The slip-on boots feature the same sturdy rubber sole, warm inner lining, and 3-inch shaft height as the Ultra-Minis, but with a price tag of just $50, you can grab three pairs for the same price as one of the original. They come in five different colors (including the iconic chestnut shade) and sizes six to 11, and shoppers say they're <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">just as nice as the real thing</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was looking for a less expensive Ugg alternative and these are the only ones I could find with the ''ultra mini' look," <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one reviewer wrote</a>. "I love them. I have had multiple pairs of Uggs and these are a great dupe! Even better quality than expected."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond just looking adorable, shoppers say these memory foam boots are warm, comfortable, and the perfect footwear option to <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">get through long days on your feet</a>. Plus, the thick sole means you can wear the boots outdoors to truly recreate the on-the-go supermodel look (green juice in hand, of course). Simply pair the boots with some leggings and a fleece jacket, and watch your basic errands outfit take on the vibe of a celeb-worthy athleisure look in mere seconds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"These are literally the perfect Ugg dupe," <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">another reviewer wrote</a>. "For the price of the real Uggs, I get three pairs of these! Great quality, comfy, and not cheap material at all… [I] got my normal size and it fits perfect! I'll be buying more for sure."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While my middle school Uggs are sadly no longer with us, if <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kaia Gerber decides Ugg-style boots are cool again</a>, then dammit, I guess it's time to grab myself a new pair.
