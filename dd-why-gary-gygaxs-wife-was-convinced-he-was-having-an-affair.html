But unlike a game with strictly defined progress and outcomes, like&nbsp;Clue or Monopoly, these mechanics merely form the framework of Dungeons & Dragons. Within it, gamers can devise whatever world, narrative, characters, and goals they want, and play infinitely. Or as Gygax's grandson told&nbsp;<a href=#>Wired</a>,&nbsp;"It's written in every man's heart — we want to feel like warriors. That's what Gramps let people do."&nbsp;</p><p>Dungeons & Dragons&nbsp;itself was inspired by '60s and '70s wargaming communities, as <a href=#>Geek and Sundry</a> tells us, and resulted from a collaboration between Gygax and friends Dave Arneson and Jeff Perren. Gygax and Perren designed the game&nbsp;Chainmail,&nbsp;which used miniatures and was meant to simulate medieval combat. Arneson, inspired by&nbsp;Chainmail,&nbsp;created Blackmoor,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Lord of the Rings-like game featuring a single hero in a fantasy setting. Gygax drove from his Lake Geneva, Wisconsin home to Arneson's place to check it out, and a mere two years later in 1974 published the first edition of&nbsp;Dungeons & Dragons.&nbsp;He couldn't find a publisher, and so he founded his own company,&nbsp;Tactical Studies Rules (TSR), to do so.</p><p>All of this took quite a bit of time, and was enough to make Gygax's wife Mary Jo suspicious of his faithfulness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BmHBtcGtfmbFuw8eyZKCZoq56qMXGmq%2BsZaees6Z51pqqZpufo8OqusKem2aglWLEor%2BMoZivoZ6ceqK6jJqdn5mZp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-donna-mills-partner-larry-gilman.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Donna Mills' partner Larry Gilman?</span></a>
