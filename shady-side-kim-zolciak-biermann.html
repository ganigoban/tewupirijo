As the cast attempted to move past the heinous allegations at the start of Season 10, Zolciak-Biermann fanned the flames when she told fellow "RHOA" star, Shereé Whitfield, that Burruss had once propositioned her for some fun below the belt. "On my kids' life, if God strikes me dead, I wouldn't let her," the mother of six said (via <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>). Burruss took to her <a href=#>Twitter</a> to clap back. She wrote, in part, "I'm sick of these b*****s lying on me. @KimZolciak I have NEVER wanted you or your box. And stop swearing on your kids while you're telling lies. Lying a*s b***h." Burn!</p><p>Ironically enough, Zolciak-Biermann is the only RHOA cast member who viewers have witnessed engaging in a full-blown, same-sex relationship. She and her ex-girlfriend, DJ Tracy Young, dated for at least eight months, according to a statement Young gave to <a href=#>Page Six</a>.&nbsp;The DJ gave more insight into their past romance in a <a href=#>tweet</a> where she confirmed she was the "receiver" in their then-relationship.</p><p>That's some major TMI, but it makes the reality star look even more shady than before. While she accused Burruss of attempting to take a dip in her lady pond, she was actually the one who was swimming in her former lover's&nbsp;ocean...if you catch our drift.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhmaoJ6e9KhmJ2xXai2pbGMpKCmZaqkuaS1wKRkm6GVp7qius1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./valentines-day-nails-x-zodiac-sign-7106087.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Valentines Day Nail Art To Wear, According to Your Zodiac Sign</span></a>
