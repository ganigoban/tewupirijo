He is currently in his final season at Sierra Canyon, and soon, he must decide where he will be going to college. Overall, there are plenty of schools that want to give him an offer. Some of these schools include <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">USC, Ohio State, and even Oregon. </a>For now, it remains to be seen where he will go, although Oregon seems to be the favorite right now. No matter what, he and his father have a lot to be excited about right now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bronny has always said that he will <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">make his decision after the season</a>. Needless to say, he could be making his decision in the coming days or weeks as his team recently lost a playoff game. They lost the match by just a couple of points, however, Bronny was solid throughout the game. He picked up 11 points and was great on the defensive end. Moreover, he came through with an incredible highlight reel play that has his name trending on Twitter.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bronny-james-jr-dunk>Bronny James Jr. Dunk</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the video clip above, you can see Bronny getting the alley-oop and dunking the ball on his opponents. This led to a standing ovation from the crowd as they couldn't believe what they had witnessed. Overall, it was a play that you would expect from his father, and not from an 18-year-old. Bronny's highlight reel has been otherworldly this year, and there is no doubt that fans have been taking notice. Hopefully, he continues to develop as a player, because as it stands, he is already a joy to watch.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Moving forward, there will be plenty of fanfare surrounding his next decision as it pertains to where he will go to school. There are a lot of schools that would love to have him. However, it is ultimately up to the young man as to where he goes. That said, let us know where you would like to see Bronny play, in the comments down below.
