Some may be shopping for a small and simple two-seater, which is ideal for smaller spaces, spare rooms, or homes for one person or two. However, those who have big families, or have a tendency to host parties and get togethers, then a larger design may be for you.&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-gid=egVTqD6Td- dir=ltr><strong>Corner sofas</strong> are popular for those with larger living rooms and open spaces, as it fits into almost every space, and ensures everyone can watch the telly in comfort or from any angle. Even if you have a smaller living room, finding one that's the right size can make the most of your space.&nbsp;</li><li data-gid=egVTqD6Td- dir=ltr>There are <strong>sofas with low backs or high backs</strong>, which make all the difference in terms of creating the illusion of more space in the home, plus provide the necessary support. And <strong>sofas which sit on higher fee</strong><strong>t,&nbsp;</strong>as opposed to close to the floor, allow light to pass, helping your space look bigger and lighter.</li><li data-gid=egVTqD6Td- dir=ltr>When it comes to <strong>fabric,</strong> it’s important to consider your lifestyle - if you have children or pets, you'll want to look for sturdy leather (unless you have cats with sharp claws), a washable fabric, removable covers or stain resistant material.&nbsp;</li><li data-gid=egVTqD6Td- dir=ltr><strong>Pull out sofas, or sofa beds,&nbsp;</strong>are space saving, and ideal for those looking to kit out a spare room or to be able to transform a living room into a temporary bedroom for guests.</li></ul><h2 data-gid=exvXBCDQfG4w dir=ltr>What are the best sofa brands?</h2><p id=eRGqTZzs05i data-wc=76>There are plenty of sofa brands to shop online, and in store. <span><a aria-label=m&s class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">Marks & Spencer</a></span> and <span><a aria-label="John Lewis" class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">John Lewis</a></span> are amongst the longest standing and trusted brands to shop furniture, including sofas. <span><a aria-label="furniture village" class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">Furniture Village</a></span>, <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">IKEA</a></span> and <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">DFS</a></span> are also go-to shopping destinations when it comes to shopping sofas.

However, our personal opinion we prefer a corner sofa so you can put your feet up - quite literally - on the longer edge, or sit upright, plus you can fit all the family. We prefer sofas with high backs to provide the necessary support comes sofa day, although lower back design may look more modern and take up less space in a small living room.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKdIOJTajrJ data-wc=40>The next consideration is filling. Memory foam filling will hold the shape, yet provide the necessary support and comfort. A hybrid filling is a good choice, although prefer stuffing filling, which is very soft and a bit more old school.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-gid=eq9J-WOpVFzq dir=ltr>Best sofas to shop in 2024: Our favourites</h2><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd1df7063113-jayden-storage-sofa-bed-marks-and-spencer-z.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Marks & Spencer sofa: Our pick</h3></p><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Editor's Note:</p><p>"M&S has a vast array of sofas available to shop online, and is one of our personal favourites when it comes to shopping for the best sofas year in and year out.
