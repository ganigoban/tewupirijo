It’s impossible,” she told us of her ensembles on The Voice. “There’s so many good choices so that’s the biggest problem, is being so blessed.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while options may fall into her lap by the dozens for the show, there’s one thing in her personal closet that she’ll never get rid of. “That’s hard. I’ve got a big ‘ol closet. I’ve got a lot of good stuff and I’m quite nostalgic,” she told us. “I think there’s a T-shirt I’ve been wearing for a week. I wore it today as well. And it’s just literally a black T-shirt, there’s like a muscle and there’s something about it. There are holes all in the right place. It’s been washed. I don’t even know where it came from. That thing is not going anywhere.” Clearly, nothing comes between Stefani and her black tee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">—With reporting by Brandi Fowler</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: 60 Seconds of Style with Gwen Stefani</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>PHOTOS: Gwen Stefani's Changing Looks</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeXrLKvedKtnJ%2BZnp56p63VqKmirJVis6K%2Fx6Kmp2WZqbKu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gerald-forsythe-net-worth-277051.html><span>←</span><span>Gerald Forsythe Net Worth</span></a>
