Sure enough, she found her footing and she's an old pro now. So, how much does Scheana make? According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity&nbsp;Net Worth</a>, she's worth $500,000 as of 2020. A half-million is nothing to scoff at, but how does that match up with her fellow SUR servers?</p><p>Since the&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules cast includes plenty of people (including <a href=#>some recent casting shake-ups</a>), we'll only look at a handful. <a href=#>Ariana Madix is worth</a> $1 million, while her boyfriend Tom Sandoval is reportedly <a href=#>worth</a> four times that amount.&nbsp;Jax Taylor is <a href=#>worth</a>&nbsp;a cool $2 million, and interestingly, his ex-girlfriend (and now <a href=#>ex-Vanderpump&nbsp;star) Stassi Schroeder</a>&nbsp;has <a href=#>earned</a> the same amount. Oh, and <a href=#>Katie Maloney-Schwartz is apparently worth</a> $500,000, just like Scheana.</p><p>Last but not least, we've got the queen bee — the namesake of it all:&nbsp;Lisa Vanderpump. <a href=#>LVP is worth a whopping $90 million</a> and earns $500,000 per season of the Bravo series, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Wait, let's rewind that real quick... Lisa makes the same amount per&nbsp;season as Scheana has accumulated in her whole career? When put like that, it's quite a gap... But even so, there's no doubt&nbsp;Scheana's career will continue to be good as gold, and with time, her net worth will surely grow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3BjaYV3e9OhoKxlmah6qbvWZqSum5hiwKS0xJqlmmWjna66ecisZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./memphis-travel-guide-where-to-stay-eat-things-to-do.html><span>←</span><span>The ultimate guide to Memphis: Where to stay and the best things to do</span></a>
