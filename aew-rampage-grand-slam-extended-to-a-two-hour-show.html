People were wondering if it would be the usual one-hour program or if it would expand into a two-hour show on Friday, September 22.</p><p>Now, All Elite Wrestling has officially confirmed that Sting and Darby Allin will team up for a tag team match at Grand Slam: Rampage. They’ll be going up against TNT Champion Christian Cage and Luchasaurus.</p><p>This tag team match has been brewing for a while. Sting and Allin have been involved in a feud with Christian Cage and Swerve Strickland. Things got intense when Sting and Allin defeated Christian and Swerve in a coffin match at the All In pay-per-view last month in late August. Additionally, Luchasaurus managed to retain the TNT Championship against Darby Allin at All Out earlier this month.</p><p>AEW has also hinted at a trios bout for the event. Swerve Strickland challenged The Young Bucks and Hangman Page on behalf of Brian Cage and The Gates of Agony during a backstage promo on Friday’s Rampage.</p><p>TNT’s schedule shows that the show is listed as a two-hour program starting at its usual time of 10 p.m. Eastern time. This suggests that fans can expect an extended and action-packed episode of Rampage during Grand Slam.</p><p>What do you think about AEW Rampage being extended to two-hours? Will you be watching the show?
